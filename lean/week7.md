**Page 1: Title Slide**
*   **Topic:** Lean Software Development / Lean Business System.
*   **Presenter:** Asst. Prof. Dr. Arda ALP, Department of Industrial Engineering.
*   **Key Point:** Introduces the lecture topic.

**Page 2: Lecture Title**
*   **Focus:** This is Lecture 5, covering "The Lean Business System".

**Page 3: The Lean Business System (Pyramid Diagram)**
*   **Concept:** Shows the structure of a Lean Business System.
*   **Layers (Bottom to Top):**
    *   Business Excellence (The overall goal)
    *   People Excellence (Having skilled and engaged people)
    *   Production Excellence & Business Process Excellence (Being very good at making things and managing processes)
    *   SMC Vision (The company's guiding goal/direction)
*   **Simple Definition:** *"Excellence"* means being very, very good at something.

**Page 4: Lean is More Than Tools**
*   **Key Point:** To successfully use Lean, a company must change its **culture**. Just using Lean tools is not enough.
*   **Simple Definition:** *"Culture"* (in a company) is the usual way people think, act, and work together.

**Page 5: Culture Definition**
*   **Definition:** Culture is "the ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society."
*   **Key Point:** This applies to companies too – it's how things are done there.

**Page 6: The Lean Enterprise (House Diagram)**
*   **Concept:** Shows the different parts of a Lean company working together.
*   **Main Parts:**
    *   Leadership and Culture
    *   Product Development
    *   Production
    *   Sales and Service
    *   Administration (Office processes)
*   **Considerations:** Lean thinks about economic (money), ecological (environment), and social (people) factors.

**Page 7: Cultural Change and Waste**
*   **Key Point:** Lean implementation requires a cultural change focused on finding and removing **waste**.
*   **Simple Definition:** *"Waste"* is anything done that uses resources (like time or materials) but doesn't add value for the customer.

**Page 8: The Lean Business System (Temple Diagram)**
*   **Goals (Roof):** Lowest Cost, Highest Quality, Shortest Lead Time (time from start to finish).
*   **Support Systems (Roof Structure):** Management System (e.g., Hoshin Kanri, A3 Project Management).
*   **Main Pillars:**
    *   **JIT (Just-In-Time):** Make or deliver things only when needed. Uses a *Pull System* (work is pulled by the next step when ready).
    *   **Jidoka:** Build quality into the process. Often involves stopping automatically if there's a problem ("Built-in Quality with Human Touch").
*   **Foundation:** Standardization (having one best way) and Stability (processes are reliable).
*   **Center:** Human Aspects (Sharing knowledge, involving people, making improvements last).

**Page 9: Characteristics Supporting Lean**
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Safety:** Always a top priority.
    *   **Standards:** Set a standard way to work, follow it, and improve it over time.
    *   **Leadership:** Managers must show the way and actively support Lean.
    *   **Partnership:** **Empower** employees (give them power/trust) to find and fix problems, working in teams.

**Page 10: Three Aspects of Lean Transformation**
*   **Key Focus Areas:** When changing to Lean, think about:
    *   **Purpose:** Why the company exists; its main goals.
    *   **People:** The employees and their skills.
    *   **Process:** How work gets done.

**Page 11: Purpose**
*   **Definition:** The company's main goal or strategic intent.
*   **How it's Achieved:** Through careful planning, making sure everyone works towards the same goal (alignment), clear communication, and respecting all **Stakeholders** (everyone affected by the company, like customers, employees, owners).

**Page 12: People**
*   **Definition:** Focuses on the skills and abilities (competence) of employees.
*   **Key Point:** These skills need to be **continuously upgraded**, especially skills related to making improvements.

**Page 13: Process**
*   **Definition:** The steps taken to do work.
*   **Key Point:** Processes should be well-designed, clearly explained (communicated), done the same way every time (executed **consistently**), and measured to ensure good results (performance).

**Page 14: Purpose and Customer Value**
*   **Key Point:** A company's purpose (to succeed and grow) depends on **continuously providing value** to the customer.
*   **Simple Definition:** *"Value"* (to the customer) is what the customer finds useful and is willing to pay for.

**Page 15: Gap Analysis**
*   **Concept:** Comparing the company's current situation ("current state") with where it wants to be ("future state").
*   **Term:** This comparison is called **Gap Analysis**. It shows the "gap" or difference.
*   **Action:** Understanding the gap helps figure out what skills and training people need to reach the future state and keep customers happy.

**Page 16: Gap Analysis Definition**
*   **Formal Definition:** A method to evaluate the differences between *actual* performance (how things are now) and *expected* performance (how things should be).

**Page 17: Gap Analysis Concept (Visual)**
*   **Key Idea:** Gap = Difference between "where we are" (Current State) and "where we want to be" (Desired State).
*   **Outcome:** Identifying the gap leads to creating an Action Plan to close it.

**Page 18: Value Stream Examination**
*   **Action:** Look at the **Value Stream** (all the steps needed to deliver a product/service).
*   **Goal:** Find which steps add value for the customer and which don't (waste).
*   **Result:** Design Lean processes that maximize value efficiently.

**Page 19: Four Cornerstones for Learning**
*   **Concept:** Four essential elements ("cornerstones") needed for learning and improvement within the company.
*   **The Four Cornerstones:**
    1.  Management System
    2.  Skills & Competence (People)
    3.  Standard Process
    4.  **Coaching** (Helping people learn and improve)

**Page 20: Lean Business System Cycle (Diagram)**
*   **Concept:** Shows how Purpose, People (Skills & Competence), and Process (Standard Process) work together in a continuous cycle.
*   **Support:** This cycle is supported by the Management System and Coaching.
*   **Goal:** To achieve continuous improvement and build a Lean culture.

**Page 21: Purpose (Reminder)**
*   **Recap:** The company's strategic goal, achieved through planning, alignment, communication, and respecting stakeholders. (Same as Page 11).

**Page 22: People (Reminder)**
*   **Recap:** Continuously upgrading employee skills and competence, especially for improvement. (Same as Page 12).

**Page 23: Standard Process (Reminder)**
*   **Recap:** Well-designed, communicated work steps that are followed consistently and measured. (Similar to Page 13).

**Page 24: Cornerstones as Enablers**
*   **Key Point:** The four cornerstones (Management System, Skills & Competence, Standard Process, Coaching) are **enablers**.
*   **Simple Definition:** *"Enablers"* are things that make it possible or easier to do something – in this case, to successfully adopt Lean.

**Page 25: Stabilisation and Improvement**
*   **Process:**
    1.  First, achieve **stabilisation** (make processes reliable and predictable).
    2.  Understand the performance "gaps" (using Gap Analysis).
    3.  **Educate the workforce** (train employees) so they can make and sustain improvements.
*   **Importance:** This education step is **vital** (very important) for improvement projects to succeed.

**Page 26: Leadership Role in Lean**
*   **Requirement:** Management must actively lead the change to Lean, setting an example (not just "lip service" - saying you support it without doing anything).
*   **Action:** Appoint "lean champions" (internal experts/leaders) to act as coaches.
*   **Goal:** To **Lead** the change and **Internalize** it (make Lean the normal way of working).

**Page 27: Lean House (Variation Diagram)**
*   **Summary View:**
    *   **Roof:** Customer Focus (Education, Improvement, Culture)
    *   **Center:** Respect for People
    *   **Pillars:** Just-In-Time (JIT) and Built-in Quality (Jidoka)
    *   **Foundation:** The four cornerstones (Management System, Skills & Competence, Standard Process, Coaching).
*   **Key Point:** Reinforces the main components of the Lean system.
