*   **Slide 1: Title Slide**
    *   Topic: Lean Software Development.

*   **Slide 2: Lecture 2 - The Value Concept**
    *   This lecture focuses on understanding 'value' in the Lean way of thinking.

*   **Slide 3: Value (Image)**
    *   Highlights the main idea for this lecture: **Value**.

*   **Slide 4: What is Value?**
    *   **Value:** Something the **customer** specifically wants and is willing to pay money for.
    *   **Customer:** The person (or company) who buys or uses the product or service.

*   **Slide 5: Value vs. Price (Image)**
    *   This picture shows a balance. Value is what the customer gets, and Price is what they pay. Lean tries to maximize value for a good price.

*   **Slide 6: Time Spent on Value**
    *   Most of our work time is often spent on things that *don't* add value (this is called **waste**).
    *   Studies show only a small part (like 5%) of our time adds real value for the customer.
    *   **Wasteful activities** include: Waiting, fixing mistakes (**reworking**), moving things unnecessarily (**transporting**, **moving**).

*   **Slide 7: What is Lean?**
    *   **Lean:** A way of working that focuses on giving more **value** to the customer by reducing waste.
    *   The main idea is "Enhancing value for the customer".

*   **Slide 8: Lean Goal**
    *   Lean aims to deliver:
        *   *What* the customer needs.
        *   *When* they need it.
        *   At the *best possible price*.

*   **Slide 9: Lean Method**
    *   Lean uses a structured plan (**methodology**) to give the most value.
    *   It achieves this by getting rid of **waste** (**elimination of waste**) in how a company (**organization**) works.
    *   **Waste:** Anything that uses resources (like time or money) but doesn't add value for the customer.

*   **Slide 10: Value Stream**
    *   Lean looks at the *whole* process from beginning to end.
    *   **Value Stream:** All the steps and actions needed to make a product or deliver a service, from the very start (like raw materials) until the customer gets it. (The picture shows steps like Stamping, Machining, Assembly).

*   **Slide 11: Key Lean Principle**
    *   A core rule in Lean is the **elimination of waste**.

*   **Slide 12: Lean = Value vs. Waste (Image)**
    *   This picture reminds us: Lean is about increasing VALUE and decreasing WASTE.

*   **Slide 13: How to Be Lean**
    *   Lean requires a shift: focus on the final product/service for the customer, not just internal processes.
    *   It needs **continuous improvement** (always trying to get better) for long-term success.
    *   Focus on three key parts of the business:
        *   **Purpose:** Why the company does what it does.
        *   **Process:** How the work gets done.
        *   **People:** Who does the work.

*   **Slide 14: Purpose, Process, People Details**
    *   **Purpose:** Improve and grow by giving value to customers. Understand where you are vs. where you need to be (**gap analysis**).
    *   **Process:** The steps to reach the purpose. Look at all steps, identify which add value and which don't. Remove unnecessary steps or make them faster/simpler (**streamline**).
    *   **People:** Need skills and training. Involve them in finding and fixing problems to drive **continuous improvement**.

*   **Slide 15: Benefits of Lean (Graph)**
    *   Lean typically **Increases**: Effectiveness (doing things well), competitiveness (beating others), productivity (making more), customer satisfaction, repeat business, job satisfaction, speed (agility).
    *   Lean typically **Reduces**: Costs, time to market, cycle times (how long a step takes), customer complaints, stress.

*   **Slide 16: Top 10 Benefits of Lean (Survey)**
    *   Lists common benefits reported by companies using Lean, like: easier management, more efficient processes, better handling of changes, increased productivity, reduced waiting time (**lead time**), lower costs.

*   **Slide 17: Real Life Results**
    *   Companies use Lean to cut costs, compete better, or stay in business.
    *   Common results: Less partly finished work (**work-in-process**), using materials faster (**inventory turns**), ability to do more work (**capacity**), faster production (**cycle-time reduction**), happier customers.

*   **Slide 18: Operational Improvements (Examples)**
    *   Surveys show big improvements like:
        *   90% less lead time (waiting time).
        *   50% more productivity.
        *   80% less work-in-process inventory.
        *   80% better quality.
        *   75% less space needed.

*   **Slide 19: Administrative Improvements (Examples)**
    *   Lean also helps office work (**administrative** tasks):
        *   Fewer errors in orders.
        *   Faster customer service (less waiting on hold).
        *   Less paperwork.
        *   Handling more orders with the same staff.
        *   Simpler steps (allowing some tasks to be done by others - **outsourced**).
        *   Fewer people leaving the company (**turnover**).
        *   Better hiring.

*   **Slide 20: Strategic Improvements (Examples)**
    *   **Strategic:** Related to long-term goals and winning in the market.
    *   Being faster, cheaper, and better quality helps companies gain more customers (**market share**) from competitors.

*   **Slide 21: Methods to Implement Lean**
    *   There are many Lean tools and methods (like **Cellular Manufacturing**, **5S**, **Kanban**, **Jidoka**, **Kaizen**, **Value Stream Mapping**). (You don't need to know all for now, just that many exist).
    *   Companies often start small, testing Lean in one area first (a **pilot** project).

*   **Slide 22: Lean Management (Toyota Way)**
    *   The Toyota Way model shows Lean Management is built on:
        *   Two Pillars: **Continuous Improvement** and **Respect for People**.
        *   Foundation: Go see problems yourself (**Genchi Genbutsu**), Improve (**Kaizen**), Challenge, Teamwork, Respect.

*   **Slide 23: Lean Management Framework (Diagram)**
    *   This framework asks key questions to guide Lean transformation: What's the problem/goal? How to improve work? What management style is needed? How to develop people's skills? What's our basic thinking/mindset?

*   **Slide 24: Value Quote**
    *   "Value is only valuable if someone values your value."
    *   Meaning: It only counts as 'value' if the *customer* thinks it's valuable.

*   **Slide 25: Identifying Value**
    *   It is critical (very important) to see value from the **customer's point of view**.

*   **Slide 26: Lean Goal (Value vs. Waste)**
    *   Lean aims to deliver clear value at the right time.
    *   How? By finding the **value-adding steps** and reducing (**minimizing**) **waste activities**.

*   **Slide 27: A Key Question**
    *   This leads to the question: Are *all* activities that don't add value considered waste?

*   **Slide 28: Identifying Value vs. Waste**
    *   Identify based on the **customer's perspective**.
    *   **Waste:** Any activity the customer doesn't get value from.
    *   Activities fall into 3 types:
        *   **Value Adding:** Adds value for customer -> **Maximize** (Do more).
        *   **Non-Value Adding but Necessary:** Doesn't add customer value, but must be done (e.g., safety checks, legal rules) -> **Optimize** (Do efficiently, minimize).
        *   **Non-Value Adding Waste (Pure Waste):** Doesn't add value, not needed -> **Eliminate** (Stop doing it).

*   **Slide 29: Value vs. Waste (Simple Definitions)**
    *   **Value:** Activity the customer benefits from, uses, and will pay for.
    *   **Waste:** Activity that is unneeded, unwanted, or uses too much effort/resources.

*   **Slide 30: Lean Foundation (Blocks)**
    *   Shows the three categories visually: VALUE (Green), NON VALUE BUT NEEDED (Yellow), WASTE (7+1 types) (Red).

*   **Slide 31: Identifying Value Tasks**
    *   Look at tasks from the **customer's viewpoint**.
    *   Tasks types:
        *   **Value-adding (VA):** Customer wants it.
        *   **Non-value adding, but necessary (NNVA):** Customer doesn't want it, but it's required (Type 2 Waste).
        *   **Non-value adding (NVA):** Pure waste (Type 1 Waste).
    *   Rule: In Lean, if a task doesn't create customer VA, it's considered **Waste** (either NNVA or NVA).

*   **Slide 32: Reducing Lead Time (Diagram)**
    *   Traditional way might just speed up work steps.
    *   Lean way focuses on removing the **Waste** (waiting time) *between* the steps to make the whole process faster.

*   **Slide 33: Understanding Value Added vs. Non-Value Added**
    *   Key is to shift focus to the **customer**.
    *   Always ask: "What do the customers want?" and "What are the customers willing to pay for?"

*   **Slide 34: Defining Value in Lean**
    *   Value in Lean = Everything the customer is willing to pay for.
    *   **Value-adding activities:** Actions that directly produce value for customers, moving the product/service closer to what they expect.

*   **Slide 35: Lean Waste**
    *   **Lean Waste:** All activities that do *not* add value for the customer.
    *   They cause problems (**inefficiencies**).
    *   Question: Does this mean all waste is useless (**redundant**)? (Leads to next slides).

*   **Slide 36: Two Types of Waste**
    *   1.  **Pure Waste:** Adds no value to anyone; should be eliminated.
    *   2.  **Necessary Waste:** Adds no *customer* value, but is required for some reason (e.g., regulations, current process limits); should be minimized/optimized.

*   **Slide 37: Pure Waste**
    *   Activities/processes that bring *zero* value.
    *   Example: Making customers wait, delays. (Part of the '7 wastes of **Muda**' - Muda is Japanese for waste).

*   **Slide 38: More Pure Waste Examples**
    *   Long waits can hurt the company's name (**reputation**).
    *   Tools or software bought but never used.

*   **Slide 39: Necessary Waste**
    *   Waste that doesn't give value *directly* to the customer, but *helps ensure* the final product/service is good.
    *   Example: **Quality Assurance (QA)** / Testing.

*   **Slide 40: Is QA Waste?**
    *   Technically, yes. According to strict Lean theory, QA is waste because the customer doesn't pay *for the act of testing*.

*   **Slide 41: Why QA is Necessary Waste**
    *   Customer doesn't pay you *to test*, BUT they expect a reliable, working product.
    *   So, you *need* QA to meet their expectations, making it necessary waste.

*   **Slide 42: QA Summary**
    *   QA doesn't bring direct value *to the customer*, but it does bring value *to the organization* (by ensuring quality), so it's necessary (for now).

*   **Slide 43: Types of Activities (Diagram)**
    *   Value Added -> Keep / Maximize (Check mark).
    *   Non-Value Added (Essential / Necessary) -> **Minimize** (Question mark).
    *   Non-Value Added (Non-Essential / Pure Waste) -> **Eliminate** (Cross mark).

*   **Slide 44: Back to the Question**
    *   Recap: Are *all* non-value added activities waste?

*   **Slide 45: The Simple Answer**
    *   **Yes.** From a strict Lean definition, anything the customer won't pay for is waste.

*   **Slide 46: But... (The Catch)**
    *   You *cannot* always remove *all* waste activities.
    *   Some waste activities (**necessary waste**) are important right now for delivering good value.

*   **Slide 47: How to Tell Waste Apart?**
    *   Presents 3 ways to help distinguish Pure Waste (eliminate) from Necessary Waste (minimize).

*   **Slide 48: Way 1: Map Your Work Process**
    *   Use **Value Stream Mapping** to understand how you deliver value.

*   **Slide 49: Why Map the Process?**
    *   Mapping helps you **visualize** (see) the process clearly (both value-added and wasteful steps).
    *   Allows you to **analyze** (study) it deeply.

*   **Slide 50: Value Stream Map Example (Diagram)**
    *   Shows process steps and the wait times between them, helping to see delays (waste).

*   **Slide 51: Mapping Detail**
    *   More detail in your map leads to more knowledge about your process.

*   **Slide 52: Way 2: Use Kanban**
    *   **Kanban:** A method (often using boards) to visualize and manage workflow.
    *   Use it to reduce waste and improve value streams.

*   **Slide 53: How Kanban Helps**
    *   Visualizing work helps find **bottlenecks** (slow points) and problems (**inefficiencies**).
    *   Helps **optimize** (improve) work delivery.

*   **Slide 54: Kanban Board Example (Image)**
    *   Shows a typical board with columns (like To Do, In Progress, Done) and tasks (like sticky notes).

*   **Slide 55: Kanban Benefits (Chart)**
    *   Common benefits: Better view of work (**visibility**), faster delivery (**throughput**), more predictable results.

*   **Slide 56: Using Visualization**
    *   Break big tasks into smaller ones.
    *   Use **portfolio visualization** to see the big picture.
    *   Helps find where waste occurs.
    *   *Before removing waste:* Analyze if it adds *any* value to the company (even if not direct customer value).

*   **Slide 57: Way 3: Gemba Walk**
    *   **Gemba Walk:** Going to where the work happens to see and learn.
    *   Get input directly from the people doing the work.

*   **Slide 58: What is a Gemba Walk?**
    *   Go to the actual workplace (**Gemba**).
    *   **Observe** employees working.
    *   Ask about their tasks.
    *   Identify ways to improve productivity.

*   **Slide 59: Gemba Walk Steps (Diagram)**
    *   Key steps include: Plan, Focus on process (not people), Ask 'why', Observe, Record findings, Don't suggest changes *during* the walk, Follow up later.

*   **Slide 60: Gemba Walk Benefits**
    *   See the *actual* workflow.
    *   **Engage** (talk with) employees.
    *   Gain knowledge about the work process.
    *   Identify **non-value added** activities.
    *   Find opportunities for continuous improvement.

*   **Slide 61: Gemba Walk (Simple 7 Steps)**
    *   A simpler view of the steps: Pick a theme, Prepare team, Focus on process, Be there, Record, Have extra eyes, Follow up.

*   **Slide 62: Why Distinguish Activities?**
    *   It's **crucial** (very important) to tell value-added and non-value-added activities apart.
    *   Quote: "The most dangerous kind of waste is the waste we do not **recognize** (see)." - Shigeo Shingo (expert on Toyota Production System).

*   **Slide 63: Handling Necessary Waste**
    *   If a waste activity is **necessary**, try to **minimize** it (make it take less time/resources).
    *   But first, you must **identify** it by understanding your process.

*   **Slide 64: 5 Principles of Lean Thinking (Diagram)**
    *   1.  **Value:** Define value from the customer's view.
    *   2.  **Value Stream:** Map all the steps that deliver value.
    *   3.  **Flow:** Make value flow smoothly without delays.
    *   4.  **Pull:** Make things only when requested by the next step or customer.
    *   5.  **Perfection:** Continuously strive to improve (**Continuous Improvement**).

*   **Slide 65: 5 Principles of Lean (More Detail)**
    *   Repeats the 5 principles, adding more description.
    *   Mentions the '7 Wastes' (Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overprocessing, Overproduction, Defects) within the diagram.

*   **Slide 66: Customer Focus**
    *   Title slide for this sub-topic.

*   **Slide 67: Customer Focus in Lean**
    *   The **customer** is the person who pays.
    *   Ask 3 questions about any activity:
        *   Would the customer pay for it?
        *   Did it transform/improve the product/service?
        *   Was it done "Right-First-Time"?
    *   Yes answers point towards value and **Customer Satisfaction**.

*   **Slide 68: If the Answer is 'No'**
    *   If 'No' to any of the 3 questions, then value is *not* being added (it's waste).
    *   This questioning must be done **continuously**.
    *   Goal: First **Identify** waste, then **Eliminate** waste.

*   **Slide 69: Identify then Eliminate Waste (Image)**
    *   Visual reminder of the Identify -> Eliminate sequence.

*   **Slide 70: Respect for People**
    *   In Lean, it's more than just politeness.
    *   It means: Setting clear expectations, ensuring people have skills/tools, and building a **culture** of **continuous improvement**.

*   **Slide 71: Engaging People**
    *   Respect involves **engaging** people (getting them involved) in problem solving and long-term process improvement.

*   **Slide 72: Daily Improvement & Skills**
    *   Lean requires daily problem solving by everyone.
    *   People's skills and experience are a **precious** (very valuable) resource.
    *   "Skills" waste is a specific type of Lean waste: Not using people's **potential**, **expertise** (special knowledge), or experience.

*   **Slide 73: Waste - Skills (Definition)**
    *   Examples: Not using everyone's abilities, not listening to people, not learning from past mistakes.

*   **Slide 74: Respect Isn't Always Easy**
    *   Acknowledge expertise but also challenge old habits (**norms**).
    *   Observe facts, find creative solutions.
    *   Managers and team members see things differently; need **mutual respect** to work together. Management provides guidance/mentoring, team provides detailed knowledge.

*   **Slide 75: Benefits of Respect (1-3)**
    *   1.  **Trust:** Leads to openness (**transparency**), teamwork (**collaboration**), new ideas (**innovation**).
    *   2.  **Knowledge:** Sharing ideas leads to better decisions.
    *   3.  **Confidence:** Leads to working more efficiently and reducing mistakes (**rework**).

*   **Slide 76: Benefits of Respect (4-5)**
    *   4.  **Motivation:** Respected people are happier, work harder, have better **morale** (team spirit).
    *   5.  **Value:** All these benefits add **value** for the project and its **stakeholders** (anyone affected). Leads to better decisions and **innovative solutions**.

*   **Slide 77: How to Show Respect (1. Lead)**
    *   Respect starts from the **top down** (leaders).
    *   Leaders must model respect.
    *   Create a culture where people feel heard and respected.

*   **Slide 78: How to Show Respect (2. Listen)**
    *   Be open to new ideas and possibilities.
    *   Listen to understand others' perspectives.
    *   Leaders should sometimes step back and let others take charge.
    *   Consider all ideas.

*   **Slide 79: How to Show Respect (3. Learn)**
    *   **Continuous Improvement** means always learning.
    *   Be willing and excited to learn.
    *   Leaders should be **humble** (know they don't know everything).
    *   Team members should be **curious** and ask questions.

*   **Slide 80: Working to Customer Demand**
    *   The **customer** determines value and speed.
    *   Leads to **"Just-In-Time" (JIT)**: What is required, when it is required.

*   **Slide 81: Just-In-Time (JIT) Explained**
    *   Use resources (time, materials, etc.) only in direct response to customer **demand**.
    *   Produce *only* what is needed to satisfy the customer.
    *   Helps eliminate waste like making too much (**overproduction**) or making things too early, or doing too much work (**overprocessing**).

*   **Slide 82: JIT Visual**
    *   Key ideas: Keep minimum stock, link processes smoothly, build the right amount at the right moment, deliver right when the customer needs it.

*   **Slide 83: JIT Example (Delivery Service)**
    *   Shows how a customer order pulls work through the system (receiving -> picking -> assembly -> shipping) just when needed.

*   **Slide 84: Where Lean Applies**
    *   Lean principles apply to **all types of activity** (manufacturing, services, software development, etc.).
    *   You don't need a physical product to use Lean thinking.
    *   Any process can be improved using basic Lean Principles.

*   **Slide 85: End Slide**
    *   Thank you slide.

*   **Slide 86: References**
    *   Lists the sources used for the lecture slides.

---
Study these points well. Focus on understanding the definitions of **Value**, **Waste** (Pure vs. Necessary), **Value Stream**, the **5 Lean Principles**, **Respect for People**, and **Just-In-Time**. Good luck with your preparation!
