**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   Topic: Lean Software Development
*   Presented by: Asst. Prof. Dr. Arda ALP
*   Department: Industrial Engineering, OSTIM Technical University

**Slide 2: Lecture Title**
*   This is Lecture 3.
*   Topic: Principles of Lean Thinking (The main ideas of how to think Lean).

**Slide 3: Lean Principles Diagram**
*   Shows a cycle with 5 main ideas for Lean:
    1.  Identify Customers and Specify **Value** (Know who you are helping and what they really need).
    2.  Identify & Map the **Stream** (See all the steps it takes to make what the customer needs).
    3.  Create **Flow** (Make the work move smoothly without stopping).
    4.  Respond to Customer **Pull** (Only make things when the customer asks).
    5.  Pursue **Perfection** (Always try to get better).
*   Goal: MAXIMISE THE **VALUE** (Give the customer the most possible good stuff).

**Slide 4: Lean Principles: Introduction - Flashback**
*   Reminder from Lecture 1: Lean helps give customers the most **value** by removing **waste** from how a company works.
    *   **Value:** What the customer wants and will pay for.
    *   **Waste:** Anything done that doesn't add value for the customer.
*   Reminder from Lecture 2: The 5 Lean principles help put Lean Thinking into practice and support **Continuous Improvement**.
    *   **Continuous Improvement:** Always trying to make things better, step by step.

**Slide 5: Lean Thinking Diagram**
*   Shows the 5 main principles of Lean Thinking again:
    *   VALUE
    *   VALUE STREAM
    *   FLOW
    *   PULL
    *   PERFECTION

**Slide 6: List of Principles**
*   Lists the 5 Lean principles again: Value, Value Stream, Flow, Pull, Perfection.
*   Shows a cycle starting and ending with the **Customer**. Everything focuses on the customer.

**Slide 7: Definitions of Lean Principles**
*   **VALUE:** Must be defined by the **customer**. What does the customer want?
*   **VALUE STREAM:** All the steps needed to make the product or service for the customer. Identify and map these steps.
*   **FLOW:** Make the work (value) move smoothly towards the customer without stopping.
*   **PULL:** Don't make things until the next step or customer asks for it. Let demand pull work through the system.
*   **PERFECTION:** Always try to get better through **Continuous Improvement**. Every action should create value.

**Slide 8: Another Cycle Diagram & 7 Wastes**
*   Shows the 5 principles as steps in a cycle:
    1.  Specify Value (Define what the customer wants).
    2.  Map the Value Stream (See all steps, value-added and non-value-added).
    3.  Establish Flow (Make work move smoothly).
    4.  Implement Pull (Make only when needed).
    5.  Work to Perfection (Remove waste, always improve).
*   Lists **7 Wastes** (things to remove because they don't add value):
    *   Transport (moving things too much)
    *   Inventory (too much stuff waiting)
    *   Motion (people moving too much)
    *   Waiting (people or things stopped)
    *   Over processing (doing more work than needed)
    *   Over production (making too much or too soon)
    *   Defects (mistakes, errors)
    *(Note: Slide 16 adds an 8th waste)*

**Slide 9: Value Title Slide**
*   Focuses on the first principle: **Value**.

**Slide 10: Defining Value**
*   Key Point: **Value** must *always* be defined from the **Customer's perspective** (how the customer sees it).

**Slide 11: Customer Perspective**
*   **Customer perspective:** Looking at a company from the view of the people who buy and use its products/services.
*   This view is very important for the company to make money (**financial success**) and sell things (**product sales**).

**Slide 12: Customer Perspective Diagram**
*   Shows key parts of focusing on the customer: Listen to feedback, Engage (talk with) customers, Prioritize support, Personalize their experience, Provide value, Empower customers.

**Slide 13: Customer Journey Diagram**
*   Shows stages a customer goes through: Awareness (first hear about company), Consideration (think about buying), Purchase, Retention (keeping customer happy), Conversion (customer recommends to others), Post-Purchase Journey (ongoing relationship). Lean tries to add value at all stages.

**Slide 14: Questions to Define Value**
*   To know if an activity adds **value**, ask:
    *   Would the customer pay for this activity?
    *   Did this activity change or improve the product/service?
    *   Was it done right the first time ("Right-First-Time")?

**Slide 15: Customer Perspective Matrix**
*   A tool to think about the customer:
    *   **Who** do we serve?
    *   **What** is most important to them?
    *   **How** are we doing on those important things?
    *   **Which** important areas can our team actually change or improve?

**Slide 16: The Eight Wastes**
*   Important: Understand the difference between **Value** and **Waste**.
*   Lean defines **Waste** as things that use resources but don't add value for the customer.
*   The **Eight Wastes** (updated from Slide 8):
    1.  **Transport:** Unnecessary movement of materials/tools.
    2.  **Inventory:** More materials/products than needed right now.
    3.  **Motion:** Unnecessary movement of people.
    4.  **Waiting:** Delays, work stopped.
    5.  **Overproduction:** Making too much, too early, or things not ordered.
    6.  **Overprocessing:** Doing extra work that isn't needed.
    7.  **Defects:** Errors, mistakes needing fixing (rework) or throwing away (scrap). Not "Right-First-Time".
    8.  **Skills:** Not using people's abilities and ideas well.

**Slide 17: Applying Waste Identification**
*   You can find waste even in your own work habits.
*   Finding waste helps find ideas for improvement.

**Slide 18: Value Stream & Value Stream Analysis**
*   **Value Stream:** All the steps (tasks) needed to make a product or provide a service. Some steps **add value** for the customer, some do **not**.
*   **Value Stream Analysis:** The purpose is to find the steps that **do not add value** (nonvalue adding activity) and try to **reduce** or **eliminate** them.
*   Analysis involves:
    *   Mapping the current steps (**current value stream**).
    *   Understanding how the product/service moves (**physical product flow**) and how information moves (**flow of information**).

**Slide 19: Value Stream Analysis (Continued)**
*   After mapping the steps, separate the **value-adding** ones from the **non-value-adding** ones.
*   Target the **non-value-adding** activities to make them better (**streamlining**) or remove them (**elimination**).
*   This is the starting point for **continuous improvement**.

**Slide 20-28: Example of a Value Stream Map (Airport Security)**
*   Shows a simple process: Passport Check -> Waiting -> Security Scan -> Waiting.
*   **Value-add time:** Time spent actually doing the necessary work on the customer/item (e.g., 20s for passport check + 30s for security scan = 50 seconds total). This is what the customer values.
*   **Waiting time:** Time spent in queues, not being worked on (e.g., 600s + 600s = 1200 seconds). This is waste.
*   **Lead time:** Total time from start to end (Value-add time + Waiting time). In the example, 1200s (wait) + 50s (value-add) = 1250s (total time).
*   Key Point: In this example, only 50 seconds (4%) of the total 1250 seconds adds value. Most of the time (96%) is waste (waiting in queues). Lean aims to reduce this waiting time.
*   **Cycle Time:** (Not clearly shown in example calculation, but mentioned on slide 27) Time it takes to do one unit of work.
*   **Process Time:** (Used interchangeably with value-add time in this example context, also called Touch time or Work time).

**Slide 29: What is Value Stream Mapping (VSM)?**
*   **Value Stream Mapping (VSM):** A drawing (**visual tool**) that shows how work (**process flow**) and information (**information flow**) move as a product or service is made, from the start (**supplier**) to the end (**customer**).
*   Process steps are usually shown at the bottom (left to right).
*   Information flow is usually shown at the top (often right to left, customer back to supplier).

**Slide 30: Generic Value Stream Map Diagram**
*   Shows the layout: Supplier info, Production Control info, Customer info at top. Process steps in the middle. Timeline (Process time, Value-add time) at the bottom.

**Slide 31: VSM Details**
*   VSM shows both **process** (work steps) and **information flow**.
*   It shows how information is used to meet **customer's requirements**.
*   In services, VSM might show how a report or file moves through steps.
*   The **timeline** at the bottom compares value-adding time to the total **overall lead time**.

**Slide 32: Value Stream Map Variants**
*   There are three types of VSMs:
    *   **Current State:** Shows how the process works *now*.
    *   **Ideal State:** Shows the perfect, long-term goal for the process.
    *   **Future State:** Shows an improved version to reach in the short/medium term, based on an action plan.

**Slide 33: Example of Current State Value Stream Map**
*   Shows a more complex manufacturing example with suppliers, customers, different process steps (Milling, Welding, Painting, Inspection), inventory ('I' triangles), timings (C/T = Cycle Time, C/O = Changeover Time), batch sizes, uptime, and lead times.
*   Key takeaway at bottom: Total Lead Time = 51 days, Value added time = 15 min. (Again, shows lots of waiting/non-value time).

**Slide 34: Highlighting Timeline on VSM**
*   Highlights the bottom timeline showing days of inventory/waiting between steps and the actual processing time within steps. Confirms the 51 days lead time vs 15 min value-added time.

**Slide 35: Flow Title Slide**
*   Focuses on the third principle: **Flow**.

**Slide 36: What is Flow?**
*   **Flow:** When work keeps moving smoothly, one piece after another, without stopping in **queues**, **waiting**, or needing **rework** (fixing mistakes).
*   Idea from Henry Ford/Toyota: Production should flow continuously from start (raw material) to finish (customer) without interruption.
*   **Mass production** (like assembly lines for cars, clothes, electronics) is also called **flow production** or **continuous production**. It uses a series of connected workstations.

**Slide 37: Single-Piece Flow**
*   Lean aims for **single-piece-flow** (or **one-piece-flow**): producing and moving only one item at a time from one step to the next.

**Slide 38: Flow for Information**
*   Important: A "piece of work" can be information too (like a file, report, or document), not just a physical product. Flow applies to information as well.

**Slide 39: Continuous Flow vs. Batch Processing**
*   **Continuous Flow:** Making and moving items one at a time. (Lean prefers this).
*   **Batch Processing:** Making a large group (**batch** or lot) of items at one step, then moving the whole batch to the next step, where it waits in a queue. (Lean avoids this). In batch processing, items must wait.

**Slide 40: Why Batch Production is Used**
*   Reasons people use batch production:
    *   Long time to set up machines (**long setup times**).
    *   Workstations are far apart (**large distances**).
    *   The steps themselves might be slow or inefficient.
*   People often think batching is efficient ("If I'm making one, I might as well make twenty"), but Lean shows it often isn't.

**Slide 41: Disadvantages of Batch Production**
*   Problems with batching:
    *   Lots of unfinished work waiting (**work in progress**).
    *   Piles of inventory waiting between steps (**work in progress inventory**).
    *   More waiting time between workstations.
    *   Long total time (**long lead times**) because the whole batch must finish each step.
    *   Often leads to late deliveries (**poor on-time delivery**).

**Slide 42: Batch Production and Quality**
*   Another problem with batching: If there's a quality issue, many products in the batch might be bad before the problem is found.
*   Finding problems later costs more to fix.

**Slide 43: Batch Processing Example**
*   Shows 10 units going through 3 processes (1 min each).
*   In batching, all 10 finish Process 1 (10 mins), then wait. All 10 finish Process 2 (10 mins), then wait. All 10 finish Process 3 (10 mins).
*   Total time for the last unit = 10 + 10 + 10 = **30 minutes**.
*   First unit finishes after 10 (P1) + 10 (P2) + 1 (P3) = 21 minutes.

**Slide 44: Single Piece Flow Processing Example**
*   Shows the same 10 units and 3 processes (1 min each).
*   In single piece flow, Unit 1 finishes P1 (1 min), moves to P2. Unit 2 starts P1.
*   Unit 1 finishes P1, P2, P3 in 1 + 1 + 1 = **3 minutes**.
*   The last unit (Unit 10) finishes after 10 units x 1 min (at P3) + 1 min (at P2) + 1 min (at P1) = **12 minutes**. *(Think: the 10th unit starts P1 at time=9, finishes P1 at time=10; starts P2 at time=10, finishes P2 at time=11; starts P3 at time=11, finishes P3 at time=12)*.

**Slide 45: Benefit of Flow vs Batch**
*   Comparing the examples:
    *   Batch: Total time = 30 minutes.
    *   Single Piece Flow: Total time = 12 minutes.
*   Result: **60% reduction in lead time** by using flow instead of batch.

**Slide 46: Benefits of Single-Piece Flow**
*   **Single-piece-flow** helps:
    *   Use resources better.
    *   Make **lead times** shorter.
    *   Find problems faster (**real-time**).
    *   Improve **quality**.
    *   Improve **communication** between steps/teams.

**Slide 47: Aim of Lean Enterprise**
*   A key goal of Lean is to **reduce batch sizes** to shorten lead times and improve delivery to the customer.

**Slide 48: Pull Title Slide**
*   Focuses on the fourth principle: **Pull**.

**Slide 49: What is Pull?**
*   **Pull** means providing *only* what the customer wants, *when* the customer wants it.

**Slide 50: Internal vs External Customers**
*   The "**Customer**" in Pull can be:
    *   **Internal:** Someone inside the organization who needs something from a previous step (e.g., another team, your colleague).
    *   **External:** The final person or company who pays for the product/service.

**Slide 51: Defining Internal and External Customers**
*   **Internal customers:** Employees, colleagues, teams who depend on your work.
*   **External customers:** End-users, clients, consumers who pay.
*   Meeting needs of both can be hard (**challenging**), especially if needs conflict or change fast.

**Slide 52: Internal vs External Customers Diagram**
*   Shows examples:
    *   Internal: Employees, Owners, Representatives.
    *   External: Suppliers, Customers, Society, Governments, Creditors, Shareholders.
    *   The Organization connects them.

**Slide 53: Push vs Pull Diagram (Pizza Example)**
*   Shows making a pizza: Customer Order (External Pull) -> Recipe -> Kneading -> Baking -> Assembling -> Customer (External Pull).
*   Internal loops: Assembling pulls from Baking, Baking pulls from Kneading, Kneading pulls from Recipe.
*   Suppliers: Dough Supplier provides to Kneading (based on pull signal), Tomato Supplier provides to Baking (based on pull signal).
*   **Product Flow** goes left to right. **Pull Signal** goes right to left (downstream asks upstream).

**Slide 54: Pull Definition (vs Forecast)**
*   **Pull:** Producing only what the next step (**downstream activities**) has used or requested.
*   This is different from producing based on a plan or **forecast** (guessing future demand), which leads to extra stock (**stock-inventory**). Pull works regardless of forecast.
*   **Downstream:** Later process steps.
*   **Upstream:** Earlier process steps.

**Slide 55: Downstream vs Upstream Example (Oil Industry)**
*   Shows example:
    *   Upstream: Finding oil (Exploration), Getting oil out (Production).
    *   Downstream: Making fuel (Refinery), Making plastics (Petrochemical).

**Slide 56: Push vs Pull Visual**
*   **Push:** Looks messy, like pushing a pile of blocks (inventory builds up).
*   **Pull:** Looks smooth, like pulling blocks in a neat line (only what's needed moves).

**Slide 57: Push vs. Pull Comparison Chart**
*   **Push:**
    *   Make things "just in case."
    *   Based on guessing future use (Approximation, Anticipated Usage).
    *   Uses Large Lots, High Inventories.
    *   Creates Waste.
    *   Leads to reacting to problems (Firefighting).
    *   Poor Communication.
*   **Pull:**
    *   Make only what's needed, when needed.
    *   Based on actual use (Precision, Actual Consumption).
    *   Uses Small Lots, Low Inventories.
    *   Reduces Waste.
    *   Uses visual signals (Management by Sight).
    *   Better Communication.

**Slide 58: Core Idea of Pull**
*   Get one process step to make *only* what the *next* process step needs, *only* when it needs it.

**Slide 59: Linking Processes with Pull**
*   To make Pull work, all process steps must be linked together, from the final customer all the way back to the start (raw material supplier).
*   This creates a smooth flow without delays, leading to:
    *   Shortest **lead time**.
    *   Highest **quality**.
    *   Lowest **cost**.

**Slide 60: Flow and Pull Slogan**
*   Simple rule: **Flow when you can; Pull when you must.** (Try to achieve continuous flow first. If you can't, use pull systems between steps where flow breaks).

**Slide 61: Pull Summary**
*   An **upstream** step should not make anything until the **downstream** Customer asks.
*   Each step signals the step before it (**next activity**) to start working (pulls from the 'front end').
*   Pull needs to work across the *whole* Value Stream, requiring sharing customer demand information with all **Suppliers**.
*   Pull reduces **time** and **waste**.

**Slide 62: Pull Example: Kanban**
*   **Kanban** is a system used to manage Pull.
*   It's a way to manage materials and refill stock (**material management and replenishment system**).
*   It uses **visual controls** (like cards, signs, or empty bins) to signal when an **upstream** process needs to make more parts because the **downstream** process (the customer) has used them.
*   Kanban helps control **overproduction** and **inventory**.

**Slide 63: Perfection Title Slide**
*   Focuses on the fifth principle: **Perfection**.

**Slide 64: Perfection Principle**
*   The last Lean principle says that **continuous improvement** is a **never ending journey**. You never fully arrive, you just keep getting better.

**Slide 65: Ultimate Objective of Perfection**
*   Perfection doesn't stop after one improvement project.
*   The ultimate goal (**ultimate objective**) is **perfection**: a state where *every action* and *every asset* creates **value** for the end customer.

**Slide 66: Path to Perfection**
*   Most activities in an organization might actually be **waste**.
*   The more waste you remove, the more waste you see!
*   Getting better is not one big jump (**step change**), but a continuous path (**path**) using **Continuous Improvement**.

**Slide 67: Continuous Improvement Model**
*   **Continuous improvement** (or **continual improvement**) means always improving products, services, or processes.
*   Improvements can be small, slow changes (**incremental**) or big, fast changes (**breakthrough**).

**Slide 68: Continuous Improvement Concept Diagram (PDCA)**
*   Shows Continuous Improvement as a cycle (like Plan-Do-Check-Act, PDCA) going uphill (getting better quality over time).
*   Standardization (making the improved way the new normal) helps lock in improvements before starting the cycle again.
*   CI helps reduce **waste** and **variation** (differences in results). Often uses Lean and Six Sigma tools.

**Slide 69: Deming Cycle (PDCA)**
*   A very common tool for continuous improvement is the **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle**, also called the **Deming Cycle**. It's a four-step method.

**Slide 70: PDCA Cycle Diagram**
*   **PLAN:** Plan ahead for a change. Analyze the situation, predict results.
*   **DO:** Try the plan (execute it), maybe on a small scale first.
*   **CHECK:** Study the results. Did the change work? Did it make things better?
*   **ACT:** If yes, make the change the new standard. If no, learn why and start again (go back to Plan).

**Slide 71: PDCA - PLAN Step**
*   PLAN phase: Identify a goal, make a theory, decide how to measure success (**success metrics**), and make a plan.
*   Establish **objectives** (what you want to achieve) and **processes** (how you'll do it).
*   Set clear **output expectations** (what the result should look like).

**Slide 72: PDCA - DO Step**
*   DO phase: Implement the plan (e.g., make the product using the new process).
*   Focus is on carrying out the plan (**implement the plan, execute the process**).

**Slide 73: PDCA - CHECK Step**
*   CHECK phase: Compare the **actual results** (measured in DO) with the **expected results** (from the PLAN).
*   Look for differences (**deviations**) and see if the plan was followed correctly (**completeness**).

**Slide 74: PDCA - ACT Step**
*   ACT phase:
    *   If CHECK shows the change was an **improvement**, make it the **new standard** (baseline).
    *   If CHECK shows it was **not an improvement**, keep the **old standard**.
    *   If CHECK showed something unexpected (better or worse), it means there's **more learning** to do (go back to PLAN).

**Slide 75: PDCA is Iterative**
*   The PDCA Cycle is an **iterative process** (it repeats). After ACT, you go back to PLAN to find the next improvement.
*   Each time you go through the cycle, quality should get better.
*   Repeating the cycle helps you **learn** more.

**Slide 76: Continuous Improvement Model Graph**
*   Shows improvement over time.
*   Green line: Quality goes up with Continuous Improvement (CI) steps, then levels off with Standardization (S), then jumps again with the next CI. This creates steady upward progress (Sustain).
*   Red line: If you don't standardize, improvements might slip back down.

**Slide 77: Continuous Improvement Summary**
*   When an improvement is done, you have a new "current state."
*   After the change is settled ("bedded in" through standardization), the process can be looked at again for more improvement.
*   Always trying to reach **Perfection** is the basis for **Continuous Improvement**.
