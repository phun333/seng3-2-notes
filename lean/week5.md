Okay class, let's focus on the key points from Lecture 4 on the Wastes of Lean to prepare for your midterm. Remember, the exam is closed-book, so understanding these concepts is crucial. I will go through the slides and give you concise notes.

CENG 314 Midterm Prep Notes: Lecture 4 - Wastes of Lean
(Based strictly on the provided PDF: week5.pdf)

Slide 1-2: Title

Topic: Lean Software Development, Lecture 4: Wastes of Lean: How to Optimize Resources.

Optimize: To make something as good or effective as possible.

Resources: Things like time, money, people, materials needed to do a job.

Slide 3: Waste (Image)

This lecture focuses on identifying and reducing "waste" in processes.

Slide 4: Waste: Introduction - Flashback

Reminder: Lecture 2 already defined "value" and "waste" and compared them.

Slide 5: Value vs. Waste (1)

Key Principle: You must see value and waste from the customer's perspective (what the customer cares about).

Waste Definition: Any activity that does not add value to the product or service for the customer.

Value Adding: Things the customer wants and pays for. -> Maximize these.

Non-Value Adding but Necessary: Required steps but customer doesn't directly value them (e.g., legal checks). -> Optimize (make efficient).

Non-Value Adding WASTE: Pure waste, adds no value. -> Eliminate (get rid of it).

Slide 6: Value vs. Waste (2)

Lean Thinking: Divides all company activities into two types:

Value: An activity the customer directly benefits from, uses, and is willing to pay for.

Waste: An activity that is unneeded, unwanted, or uses too much effort (excess effort).

Slide 7: Waste: Introduction - Flashback (Repeat)

Reiterates: Lean separates activities into those that add value and those that do not (waste).

Slide 8: The 7 Wastes! (+ Skills)

Introduces the common categories of waste. Originally 7, often an 8th ("Skills") is added.

The 7 Wastes (often remembered by TIMWOOD): Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over-processing, Defects.

Slide 9: The Eight Wastes (Definitions)

Know these 8 types of waste:

Transport: Unnecessary movement of things (materials, documents, tools).

Inventory: Having more stuff (materials, work-in-progress, finished goods) than needed right now.

Motion: Unnecessary movement of people (walking, searching, reaching).

Waiting: Delays; time when work is stopped (waiting for parts, machines, people, information).

Overproduction: Making too much, too soon, or faster than needed by the next step or customer. Often considered the worst waste.

Over-processing: Doing more work on a product/service than the customer requires (e.g., extra features, unnecessary steps, too much detail).

Defects: Errors, mistakes, needing rework or scrap. Not doing it right the first time.

Skills: Not using people's abilities, ideas, or experience fully.

Slide 10-11: Waste: Transport

Definition: Unnecessary movement of product, raw material, or documents.

Impact: Increases risk of damage/loss, adds time, adds cost, without adding value.

Goal: Reduce the "mileage" or movement.

Slide 12: Causes of Transportation Waste

Poor factory/office layout.

Poor understanding of the process flow.

Large batch sizes, long lead times (time from start to finish), large storage areas.

Slide 13: Transport Examples

Manufacturing: Moving materials unnecessarily.

Service/Admin: Moving documents/information between locations.

Healthcare: Storing supplies far away, causing long transit times.

Food: Taking finished goods out for rework.

Slide 14-15: Waste: Inventory

Definition: Accumulation (build-up) of finished product, raw material, or partially completed work. Can also be electronic files or documents in an office.

Impact: Costs money (storage, tied-up cash) with no benefit to the customer.

Often results from: Poor process design, overproduction, unbalanced workflows.

Slide 16: Causes of Excess Inventory

Trying to protect against problems (inefficiencies, unexpected issues).

Complex products.

Uneven scheduling or workload.

Poor market forecasts (guessing demand wrongly).

Unreliable suppliers.

Misunderstood communication.

Slide 17: Reducing Inventory

Key Idea: Inventory should be systematically reduced (lowered step-by-step).

Why: Holding stock (inventory) hides problems. Reducing stock exposes issues and forces the company to fix them.

Slide 18: Inventory Examples

Manufacturing: Making products based on forecasts (guesses) instead of actual customer orders.

Service/Admin: Excess Work-In-Progress (WIP), long queues of people waiting.

Healthcare: Excess stock of medicine or supplies.

Food: Unsold frozen meat due to inaccurate forecasts.

Slide 19-20: Waste: Motion

Definition: Time wasted by individuals moving around when they don't need to (e.g., walking to get parts, searching for tools). Different from Transport (moving things).

Solution: Workplace organization (like 6S) to keep tools/materials close.

Impact: Reduces distance traveled, saves time, reduces employee strain.

Slide 21: Causes of Motion Waste

Poor workplace layout.

Inconsistent work methods.

Poor organization and housekeeping.

Extra movements while waiting.

Slide 22: Motion Examples

Manufacturing/Service/Admin: Walking, manually accessing files, searching for people/things.

Healthcare: Searching for information, people, supplies.

Food: Handling items multiple times, walking due to poor layout, searching for packaging.

Slide 23-24: Waste: Waiting

Definition: Time an item spends between process steps when no work is being performed. Adds no value.

Example: In batch production, items wait while the rest of the batch is processed.

Slide 25: Reducing Waiting

Ideal: Produce a single piece at a time ('Single-Piece-Flow').

Goal: Reduce batch size to reduce waiting between operations.

Applies to: Physical items and information (e-mail, reports).

Method: Schedule work in small amounts to allow smooth, timely flow.

Slide 26: Causes of Waiting Waste

Unbalanced workload.

Unplanned machine maintenance.

Long process set-up times.

Upstream quality problems (errors from earlier steps).

Un-levelled scheduling (workload not smooth).

Slide 27: Waiting Examples

Manufacturing: Waiting for a batch to finish, machine downtime.

Service/Admin: Waiting for work from a previous step, system downtime.

Healthcare: Waiting for appointments, test results.

Food: Waiting during machine changeovers.

Slide 28-29: Waste: Overproduction

Definition: Producing what is not required. Making items in greater volume than needed, sooner than needed, or faster than needed.

Impact: Directly leads to Inventory waste. Results from not responding to customer demand.

Causes other wastes: Often considered the most serious waste.

Slide 30: Overproduction specifics

Making more than required by the next process.

Making earlier than required by the next process.

Making faster than required by the next process.

Slide 31: Solution to Overproduction

Work to customer demand.

Improve flow through steps.

Produce only what the customer needs, when they need it (Just-In-Time principle).

Try to keep the production load (amount of work) consistent.

Slide 32: Overproduction Examples

Manufacturing: Making products just to keep machines/people busy.

Service/Admin: Producing reports earlier/more than needed.

Healthcare: Duplicating information entry.

Food: Producing food when there are no sales orders.

Slide 33-34: Waste: Over-processing

Definition: Doing more work than is required to meet customer expectations. Performing wasteful steps that are not needed.

Solution: Understand exactly what is required, then simplify and standardize processes.

Standardize: To make things of the same type have the same basic features.

Slide 35: Causes of Processing Waste

"Just-in-case" logic (doing extra just in case).

True customer requirements not clearly defined.

Lack of communication.

Redundant approvals (too many sign-offs).

Slide 36: Over-processing Examples

Manufacturing: Using packaging that is too complex or high-quality for the part.

Service/Admin: Duplicate operations, unnecessary complexity.

Healthcare: Collecting information that is not required or used.

Food: Trimming meat more than the specification requires.

Slide 37-38: Waste: Defects

Definition: Not doing the job "Right-First-Time". A defect is an error, a deviation (difference) from the product specification, leading to customer dissatisfaction.

Impact: Leads to costly reworking, double handling, extra time, risk of more damage.

Service examples: Data input errors, incorrect reports, billing errors.

Slide 39: Causes of Defects

Weak process control.

Poor quality of incoming materials/information.

Deficient (not enough) planned maintenance.

Inadequate (not good enough) training or work instructions.

Poor product design.

Customer needs not understood.

Slide 40: Defects Examples

Manufacturing: Parts not made to specification (scrap or rework).

Service/Admin: Data input errors.

Healthcare: Errors in reports, tests, or billing.

Food: Wrong labels, poor seals, damaged packaging.

Slide 41: Reducing Defects (1)

Ensure work steps are highly specified (clear, no ambiguity/doubt).

Have required tools/equipment present and working well.

Use clear, concise instructions (photos help).

Train personnel well in all aspects of the job.

Slide 42: Reducing Defects (2)

Key Idea: Each person is responsible and accountable for the quality of their work.

Concept: Aim for "Right-First-Time".

Principle: The job should be done once and correctly. Internalize this responsibility (make it part of your thinking).

Slide 43: Reducing Defects (3) - Error-Proofing

Concept: "Error-proofing" (also called Poka-Yoke) is used to reduce defects.

Definition: Implementing fail-safe mechanisms (designs or procedures that prevent mistakes) to stop defects from being produced.

Goal: Prevent errors, or eliminate/detect defects immediately.

Principle: Defects should never be passed to the next operation. Fixing defects later costs much more.

Slide 44: Approaches to Error Proofing

There's a hierarchy (ranking) of effectiveness:

Make it impossible for the error to occur (Best).

Make it harder to create the error.

Make it possible to reverse the error (e.g., easy fix).

Make the process tolerate the error (less impact).

Make it obvious that the error has occurred (e.g., warning light).

Warn people about potential error (Weakest - "Be Careful" signs).

Slide 45: Poka-Yoke

Definition: An error-proofing technique or methodology.

Goal: Design processes so errors are not allowed to occur.

Example: A plug that only fits into a socket one way.

Slide 46: Benefits of Poka-Yoke

Reduced training time.

Improved safety.

Reduced waste (less rework/scrap).

Higher productivity.

Promotes a culture of continuous improvement.

Slide 47-48: Waste: Skills (Underutilized People)

Definition: Management not fully using employees' skillsets, experience, or ideas.

Underutilized: Not used as much as possible.

Relates to: The Lean principle of "Respect-For-People".

Slide 49: Utilizing Skills

Lean Culture: Depends on all team members contributing ideas for improvement.

Respect-for-people means: Acknowledge expertise, challenge old ways, use data, design creative solutions. Internalize this.

Slide 50: Causes of People Waste (Skills Waste)

Old ways of thinking, company politics, bad culture.

Poor hiring practices.

Low or no investment in training.

Low pay, high employee turnover (people leaving often).

Slide 51: Skills Waste Examples

This looks similar in many areas: Failing to use the skills or capabilities of the entire workforce.

Slide 52-53: Waste in Different Environments

Identifying waste should start from the top (management).

Management's job: Improve processes and spread a culture of continuous improvement (always trying to get better).

Slide 54: Waste Varies

Wasteful activities may vary from business to business and in different departments (functional areas).

Slide 55: Wastes in Lean Manufacturing (Examples)

Transport (moving parts), Inventory (unsold goods), Motion (worker movement), Waiting (for delivery), Overproduction ("just in case"), Over-processing (unwanted features), Defects (broken parts).

Slide 56: Wastes in Software Development (Examples)

Transport (task switching, interruptions), Inventory (undelivered code), Motion (unneeded meetings), Waiting (for testing/review), Overproduction (unused features), Over-processing (complex code for simple problems), Defects (bugs).

Slide 57: Wastes in Marketing (Examples)

Transport (task switching), Inventory (unlaunched campaigns), Motion (unneeded meetings), Waiting (for approval), Overproduction (activities without strategy), Over-processing (manual reports), Defects (wrong branding).

Slide 58: Wastes in Project Management (Examples)

Transport (task switching), Inventory (unused tools), Motion (bad workspaces, searching info), Waiting (for approval), Overproduction (unnecessary documents), Over-processing (too many approvals), Defects (incorrect data).

Slide 59: Waste is Contextual

The list of specific wastes is endless and differs by business. The 7/8 wastes are categories to help find them.

Slide 60: Action on Waste

Important: Start exploring all processes and try to find as many wasteful activities as possible.

Goal: Do whatever it takes to eliminate everything that slows things down, hurts quality, uses extra resources, or lowers profit.

Slide 61-62: Combined Methods: Lean Six Sigma (1)

Definition: A globally proven method combining Lean and Six Sigma for improvement.

Approach: Uses a structured method called DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) for continuous improvement.

Synergy: Lean (reduces waste) + Six Sigma (reduces defects/variation) = Faster, more efficient problem solving.

Slide 63: Lean Six Sigma (2)

Goal: Improve performance by eliminating waste (Lean) and process/product defects (Six Sigma).

Combines methods of Six Sigma and Lean Enterprise.

Slide 64: Lean Six Sigma (3)

Focus: Starts with what customers value.

Benefits: Reduces costs, increases customer satisfaction, shortens lead time.

Strength: Uses existing knowledge/experience of people.

Improves both process (flow - Lean) and quality (stability - Six Sigma).

Slide 65-66: Lean Six Sigma (4 & 5)

Lean and Six Sigma reinforce each other and are complementary (work well together).

They both start from customer wishes and improve processes together with employees.

Tackles problems at the core and ensures continuous improvement.

Slide 67: Benefits of Using Lean Six Sigma

Helps companies combat rising costs and competition.

Leads to: Increased profit, reduced costs, improved efficiency/effectiveness, employee development, employee satisfaction, customer satisfaction.

Slide 68: What Is Six Sigma?

More data-driven than traditional Lean.

Developed by Motorola.

Uses the DMAIC approach to ensure the root cause of a problem is found before fixing it.

Root Cause: The fundamental reason why a problem occurs.

Slide 69: DMAIC Cycle

Know the 5 steps:

Define: Define the problem clearly.

Measure: Measure the current process and the size of the problem (collect data).

Analyze: Analyze the data to find the root cause(s) of the problem.

Improve: Develop, test, and implement solutions to fix the root cause.

Control: Maintain the solution, monitor the process to ensure improvements last.

Slide 70: Lean Principles: Perfection

Final Principle: Continuous improvement is a never-ending journey. Always strive to get better.
