**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Topic:** Lean Software Development.
*   **Note:** This lecture discusses ideas from "Lean" thinking applied to development processes.

**Slide 2: Lecture Title**
*   **Topic:** Wastes of Lean: How to Optimize Resources.
*   **Note:** The main goal is to learn about different kinds of "waste" in processes and how to reduce them to use resources (like time, effort, materials) better.

**Slide 3: Waste (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Introduction to Waste.
*   **Note:** This lecture focuses on identifying and dealing with "waste".

**Slide 4: Waste: Introduction - Flashback**
*   **Topic:** Previous Concepts.
*   **Note:** Reminds us that "value" and "waste" were defined in Lecture 2. This lecture builds on that.

**Slide 5: Value vs. Waste (Definition & Chart)**
*   **Topic:** Defining Waste and Value from the Customer's View.
*   **Key Term:** **Waste:** Any activity that uses resources but does *not* add value for the customer. (Value means something the customer cares about and would pay for).
*   **Key Concept:** Lean looks at work from the customer's perspective. We want to:
    *   *Maximize* activities that add value.
    *   *Optimize* (reduce but maybe not eliminate) activities that don't add value but are necessary.
    *   *Eliminate* activities that are pure waste (add no value).

**Slide 6: Value vs. Waste (Simple Definitions)**
*   **Topic:** Simple Comparison of Value and Waste.
*   **Key Term:** **Value:** An activity the customer benefits from, uses, and is willing to pay for.
*   **Key Term:** **Waste:** An activity that is not needed, not wanted, or uses too much effort.
*   **Key Concept:** All work done by a company falls into one of these two categories: adding value or not adding value (waste).

**Slide 7: Waste: Introduction - Flashback**
*   **Topic:** Reinforcing Lean Thinking.
*   **Note:** Repeats the idea that Lean separates activities into value-adding and non-value-adding (waste).

**Slide 8: The 7 Wastes! (Diagram)**
*   **Topic:** Overview of Waste Categories.
*   **Key Concept:** Lean originally identified 7 types of waste (Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects). Sometimes an 8th, "Skills," is added.

**Slide 9: The Eight Wastes (List & Definitions)**
*   **Topic:** Definitions of the 8 Wastes.
*   **Key Terms & Simple Definitions:**
    *   **Transport:** Moving things (items, information, tools) around unnecessarily.
    *   **Inventory:** Having too much material, unfinished work, or finished product sitting around.
    *   **Motion:** People moving unnecessarily (walking, reaching, searching).
    *   **Waiting:** Time when work is stopped (waiting for parts, information, approvals, machines).
    *   **Overproduction:** Making more than is needed right now, or making it too early.
    *   **Overprocessing:** Doing more work on something than the customer requires or values.
    *   **Defects:** Mistakes or errors that require fixing (rework) or cause things to be thrown away (scrap). Not doing it right the first time.
    *   **Skills:** Not using people's knowledge, ideas, or abilities fully.

**Slide 10: Waste: Transport (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Transport Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the first type of waste.

**Slide 11: Waste: Transport (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Transport Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Unnecessary movement of *things* (products, materials, documents). It adds cost, time, and risk (like damage) but zero value to the customer. Often caused by poor layout or working in large batches. Aim to reduce the "mileage" items travel.

**Slide 12: TRANSPORT - Causes of Transportation Waste**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Transport Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include:
    *   Bad physical layout of the workspace.
    *   Not understanding the flow of work.
    *   Working with large batches, leading to long waits and needing large storage areas.

**Slide 13: Transport Examples**
*   **Topic:** Transport Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Gives examples like moving materials in a factory, moving documents between offices, or even moving finished food for rework.

**Slide 14: Waste: Inventory (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Inventory Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the second type of waste.

**Slide 15: Waste: Inventory (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Inventory Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Accumulation of too much *stuff* – raw materials, partially finished work (WIP), finished products, or even documents/files in an office. Holding excess costs money (storage, management, potential damage) but gives no benefit to the customer. Often results from making too much (Overproduction) or uneven workflows.

**Slide 16: INVENTORY - Causes of excess Inventory**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Inventory Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Often held "just in case" due to other problems like unreliable suppliers, bad demand forecasts, complex products, poor scheduling, or unbalanced workloads.

**Slide 17: Waste: Inventory (Why Reduce It)**
*   **Topic:** The Problem with Hiding Issues.
*   **Key Concept:** Excess inventory can hide problems in the process (like machine breakdowns or quality issues). Reducing inventory forces these problems into the open so they must be solved.

**Slide 18: Inventory Examples**
*   **Topic:** Inventory Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include making products based on forecasts instead of actual orders, queues of waiting work or people, excess medical supplies, or unsold food due to inaccurate forecasts.

**Slide 19: Waste: Motion (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Motion Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the third type of waste.

**Slide 20: Waste: Motion (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Motion Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Unnecessary movement of *people* – walking to get tools, searching for information, excessive reaching or bending. Different from Transport (moving things). Improving workplace organization (like using the "6S" method) can reduce motion, save time, and make work easier for employees.

**Slide 21: MOTION - Causes of Motion Waste**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Motion Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include inefficient work methods, poor workplace layout, disorganization, or doing unnecessary physical actions while waiting.

**Slide 22: Motion Examples** *(Note: Slide title incorrectly says Transport)*
*   **Topic:** Motion Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include excessive walking, searching for files or tools, manually accessing things that could be closer, or handling items multiple times.

**Slide 23: Waste: Waiting (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Waiting Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the fourth type of waste.

**Slide 24: Waste: Waiting (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Waiting Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Time spent idle between process steps where no work is being done and no value is added. Example: In batch production, items finished early in a step have to wait for the rest of the batch before moving on.

**Slide 25: Waste: Waiting (Reducing It)**
*   **Topic:** Using Flow to Reduce Waiting.
*   **Key Term:** **Single-Piece-Flow:** An ideal where items are produced and moved one at a time (or in very small batches) instead of large batches.
*   **Key Concept:** The goal is smooth, continuous flow. Producing in smaller increments (ideally one piece) reduces waiting time between steps. This applies to information/digital work too (e.g., handling emails or reports quickly).

**Slide 26: WAITING - Causes of Waiting Waste**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Waiting Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include unbalanced workloads (some steps faster than others), unplanned machine downtime, long setup times between tasks, upstream quality problems, poor scheduling, or delays from inspection/rework.

**Slide 27: Waiting Examples** *(Note: Slide title incorrectly says Transport)*
*   **Topic:** Waiting Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include machines waiting for batches, people waiting for approvals or information, patients waiting for appointments or results, or machinery stopped during changeovers.

**Slide 28: Waste: Overproduction (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Overproduction Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the fifth type of waste.

**Slide 29: Waste: Overproduction (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Overproduction Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Producing more than is needed by the next step or the customer *right now*, producing it earlier than needed, or faster than needed. Often considered the worst waste because it causes other wastes (like excess Inventory, Transport, Defects). It's a result of not matching production to actual demand.

**Slide 30: OVERPRODUCTION (Types)**
*   **Topic:** How Overproduction Happens.
*   **Note:** Breaks it down into making *more* than required, *earlier* than required, or *faster* than required by the next process.

**Slide 31: OVERPRODUCTION (Solution)**
*   **Topic:** Reducing Overproduction Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** The solution is to work based on actual customer demand. Improve the flow so you can produce *only* what the customer needs, *when* they need it. Try to keep the production workload level or consistent to help plan resources better.

**Slide 32: Overproduction Examples**
*   **Topic:** Overproduction Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include making products just to keep machines busy, producing reports earlier than needed, unnecessary duplication of information, or producing food when there are no orders.

**Slide 33: Waste: Overprocessing (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Overprocessing Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the sixth type of waste.

**Slide 34: Waste: Overprocessing (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Overprocessing Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** Doing more work on a product or service than the customer actually values or requires. This includes performing steps that aren't needed, using overly complex tools or methods, or adding features nobody wants. Eliminate it by clearly understanding customer needs and simplifying/standardizing the work.

**Slide 35: OVERPROCESSING - Causes of Processing Waste**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Overprocessing Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include unclear customer requirements, using "just-in-case" logic, making product changes without updating the process, poor communication, or having too many unnecessary approvals.

**Slide 36: Overprocessing Examples**
*   **Topic:** Overprocessing Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include using excessive packaging, performing redundant checks or operations, collecting information that isn't used, or trimming food more than the specification requires.

**Slide 37: Waste: Defects (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Defects Waste.
*   **Note:** Introduces the seventh type of waste.

**Slide 38: Waste: Defects (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Defects Waste.
*   **Key Term:** **Right-First-Time:** The goal of doing work correctly the very first time, without errors.
*   **Key Concept:** Defects are errors or mistakes that result in a product or service not meeting specifications. This leads to customer dissatisfaction and extra costs due to rework (fixing the mistake) or scrap (throwing it away). Rework takes extra time, adds cost, and risks further damage.

**Slide 39: DEFECTS - Causes of Defects**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Defects Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include poor process control, low-quality input materials, inadequate training or instructions, poor product design, lack of machine maintenance, or not understanding customer needs correctly.

**Slide 40: Defects Examples**
*   **Topic:** Defects Waste in Different Fields.
*   **Note:** Examples include parts made incorrectly, data input errors, errors in medical reports or billing, or food products with wrong labels or damaged packaging.

**Slide 41: Waste: Defects (Reducing It - Part 1)**
*   **Topic:** How to Reduce Defects (Process & Tools).
*   **Key Concepts:** Defects can be reduced by:
    *   Having clear, unambiguous specifications for work.
    *   Ensuring needed tools are available and working well (workplace organization helps).
    *   Providing clear, concise instructions (using photos helps).
    *   Properly training personnel.

**Slide 42: Waste: Defects (Reducing It - Part 2)**
*   **Topic:** How to Reduce Defects (Responsibility).
*   **Key Concepts:** Quality is everyone's responsibility. Each person should aim to do their job "Right-First-Time". Build quality into the process rather than relying on inspection to catch errors later (customers don't want to pay for inspection).

**Slide 43: Waste: Defects (Error-Proofing)**
*   **Topic:** Introducing Error-Proofing (Poka-Yoke).
*   **Key Term:** **Error-proofing (Poka-Yoke):** Designing a process or tool in a way that prevents mistakes from happening, or makes them immediately obvious. (Poka-Yoke is the Japanese term).
*   **Key Concept:** Use "fail-safe" mechanisms in design and process to make errors impossible or easy to detect right away. Fixing defects early is much cheaper than fixing them later.

**Slide 44: Waste: Approaches to Error Proofing**
*   **Topic:** Levels of Effectiveness in Error-Proofing.
*   **Key Concept:** There's a hierarchy for preventing errors:
    *   Best: Make the error impossible to occur.
    *   Good: Make the error hard to create or easy to reverse.
    *   Okay: Make the error obvious when it happens (Inspection).
    *   Weakest: Just warn people to "Be Careful".
    *   (Levels 1-2 are true Error Proofing).

**Slide 45: Waste: POKA-YOKE (Example)**
*   **Topic:** Visualizing Poka-Yoke.
*   **Note:** Shows a simple example (like a USB plug that only fits one way) and reinforces that Poka-Yoke is a design method to prevent errors.

**Slide 46: Waste: Benefits of Poka-Yoke**
*   **Topic:** Advantages of Error-Proofing.
*   **Key Concepts:** Using Poka-Yoke can lead to reduced training time, better safety, less waste, higher productivity, and helps build a culture of continuous improvement.

**Slide 47: Waste: Skills (Underutilized People) (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Focus on Skills Waste (The 8th Waste).
*   **Note:** Introduces the eighth type of waste.

**Slide 48: Waste: Skills (Underutilized People) (Explanation)**
*   **Topic:** Understanding Skills Waste.
*   **Key Term:** **Respect-For-People:** A core Lean principle about valuing employees, their knowledge, and their potential to contribute.
*   **Key Concept:** This waste occurs when management doesn't make full use of employees' skills, experience, intelligence, and creativity. It's linked to not respecting people.

**Slide 49: Waste: Skills (Underutilized People) (Importance)**
*   **Topic:** Why Using Skills is Crucial for Lean.
*   **Key Concepts:** Lean relies on *continuous improvement*, which means constantly finding ways to get better. This requires ideas and effort from *all* team members. Companies need to tap into their employees' expertise, encourage them to question old ways, and empower them to find and implement solutions.

**Slide 50: SKILLS - Causes of people waste**
*   **Topic:** Reasons for Skills Waste.
*   **Key Concepts:** Common causes include outdated management thinking or company culture, poor hiring practices, lack of investment in training, low pay leading to high turnover, and not involving people in decisions that affect their work.

**Slide 51: Skills Examples**
*   **Topic:** Skills Waste is Universal.
*   **Note:** This waste applies to all sectors – manufacturing, service, healthcare, food, etc. – failing to use the full capabilities of the workforce.

**Slide 52: Waste in Different Environments (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Waste Varies by Context.
*   **Note:** Transition to showing how waste looks different in various settings.

**Slide 53: Waste in Different Environments (Management Role)**
*   **Topic:** Leadership in Waste Reduction.
*   **Key Concept:** Identifying and reducing waste should start from the top. Management has the overview and the responsibility to improve processes and promote a culture where everyone works on continuous improvement.

**Slide 54: Waste in Different Environments (Context Matters)**
*   **Topic:** Waste Examples Depend on the Area.
*   **Note:** The specific actions considered "waste" can differ between industries or even departments.

**Slide 57: Wastes in Marketing**
*   **Topic:** 7 Wastes Examples in Marketing.
*   **Note:** Lists the 7 wastes with examples from marketing work (e.g., task switching, unlaunched campaigns, pointless meetings, waiting for approvals, unfocused activities, manual reports, branding errors).

**Slide 58: Wastes in Project Management**
*   **Topic:** 7 Wastes Examples in Project Management.
*   **Note:** Lists the 7 wastes with examples from managing projects (e.g., task switching, unused tools, searching for info, waiting for approvals, excessive documentation, too many approval levels, incorrect data).

**Slide 59: Waste in Different Environments (Not Exhaustive)**
*   **Topic:** Waste Categories are Guides.
*   **Key Concept:** The list of wastes (7 or 8) is a framework, not a complete list. The specific ways waste appears will differ from place to place, and some people identify even more types.

**Slide 60: Waste in Different Environments (Action is Key)**
*   **Topic:** The Goal: Find and Eliminate Waste.
*   **Key Concept:** The most important thing is to actively look for *all* forms of waste in your processes and then take action to eliminate them. Removing waste improves speed, quality, cost, and profit.

**Slide 61: Combined Methods (Image)**
*   **Topic:** Combining Lean with Other Approaches.
*   **Note:** Transition to discussing Lean Six Sigma.

**Slide 62: Combined Methods: Lean Six Sigma (Intro)**
*   **Topic:** Introducing Lean Six Sigma.
*   **Key Term:** **Lean Six Sigma:** A combined method using Lean tools (to reduce waste and improve speed) and Six Sigma tools (to reduce defects and variation).
*   **Key Term:** **DMAIC:** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) - The structured problem-solving method used in Six Sigma.
*   **Key Concept:** Combining Lean and Six Sigma aims for faster, more effective process improvement.

**Slide 63: Combined Methods: Lean Six Sigma (Core Idea)**
*   **Topic:** What Lean Six Sigma Does.
*   **Key Term:** **Variation:** Inconsistency or unpredictability in a process or its results. Six Sigma focuses on reducing this.

**Slide 67: Combined Methods: Benefits of Using Lean Six Sigma**
*   **Topic:** Business Advantages.
*   **Key Concepts:** Lean Six Sigma helps companies deal with costs and competition, and can lead to: increased profit, reduced costs, better efficiency/effectiveness, employee development, and higher employee and customer satisfaction.

**Slide 68: What Is Six Sigma? (Introduction)**
*   **Topic:** Basics of Six Sigma.
*   **Key Term:** **Data-driven:** Relying on facts, measurements, and analysis (data) to make decisions.
*   **Key Term:** **Root Cause:** The fundamental, underlying reason for a problem.
*   **Key Concepts:** Six Sigma is a highly data-driven improvement method. Its structured DMAIC approach ensures you find the real root cause of a problem before trying to fix it. It uses employee skills effectively.

**Slide 69: What Is Six Sigma? DMAIC (Diagram)**
*   **Topic:** The Steps of DMAIC.
*   **Key Concepts:** The 5 steps are:
    *   **Define:** Clearly state the problem.
    *   **Measure:** Collect data to understand the current situation and size of the problem.
    *   **Analyze:** Use data to find the root cause(s) of the problem.
    *   **Improve:** Develop, test, and implement solutions to fix the root cause.
    *   **Control:** Put measures in place to make sure the problem stays fixed and the improvements last.

**Slide 70: Lean Principles: Perfection**
*   **Topic:** The Final Lean Principle.
*   **Key Term:** **Perfection (Lean context):** The continuous, ongoing effort to improve and eliminate all waste. It's a journey, not a destination.
