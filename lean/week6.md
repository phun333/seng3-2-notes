**Page 1-2: Introduction**

*   **Topic:** Lean Software Development.
*   **Lecture Focus:** The Lean Business System.

**Page 3 & 6: House of Lean – House of Quality (Basic View)**

*   **Concept:** A way to picture how Lean works, like building a house.
*   **Goal (Roof):** The *Customer* and satisfying their needs.
*   **Pillars (Walls):** Delivering *On-time* and with good *Quality*.
*   **Center:** *Continuous Improvement* - always getting better.
*   **Foundation (Base):** *Stability* - making work simple, standard (done the same way), and sharing knowledge.

---

**Page 4: Primary Objective of Lean**

*   **Main Goal:** Understand what the *customer* truly *values* (finds useful or important).
*   **Action:** Organize work to give the customer the *most value* possible and meet their expectations.

---

**Page 5: Purpose of the House of Lean**

*   **What it is:** A *framework* (a basic structure or model).
*   **What it shows:** How the Lean system works towards one main goal: meeting the *customer's expected standards* (what the customer hopes for).

**Page 7: The House of Lean - Tools (Based on TPS - Toyota Production System)**

*   This is a more detailed view, often used in manufacturing.
*   **Goal (Roof):** Best Quality, Lowest Cost, Shortest Lead Time (time from start to finish), Best Safety, High Morale (happy workers).
*   **Pillar 1: Just-In-Time Flow:** Getting the right parts, in the right amount, at the right time. Includes concepts like smooth workflow and 'Pull' systems (don't make something until it's needed).
    *   *Takt time:* The pace needed to meet customer demand.
    *   *Andon:* A signal to alert problems.
*   **Pillar 2: Motivated People:** Workers have clear goals, good training, and responsibility (*Accountability* = being responsible for results). Teamwork is key.
*   **Pillar 3: Jidoka (Built-in Quality / First Time Right):** Stop work immediately if there's a problem (*Automatic Stops*), find and fix errors (*Error proofing*). Quality is checked during the process (*In Station QC*).
*   **Foundation: Standardization:** Having stable, predictable operations. Includes standard ways of working (*Standard work*), visual controls (*Visual Mgmt.*), keeping equipment working (*Total Prod Maint.*), and continuous improvement (*Kaizen*).
    *   *Kaizen:* A Japanese word meaning "change for better" or continuous improvement.

**Page 8 & 9: The SAFe® House of Lean Model**

*   **What it is:** A Lean House model specifically for *SAFe* (Scaled Agile Framework - a system for large-scale software development). It's a system for *knowledge* and *learning*.
*   **Structure:** Like a house: Foundation, 4 Pillars, and the Goal (Roof).
*   **Goal (Roof): Value**
    *   Deliver value quickly and sustainably (can keep doing it).
    *   Best quality and value for people/society.
    *   High morale, safety, happy customers (*customer delight*).
*   **Foundation (Base): Lean-Agile Leadership**
    *   Leaders use Lean thinking for decisions.
    *   They act as examples of the Lean-Agile mindset.
    *   They teach these ideas to others.
*   **Pillars (Walls):**
    *   1. Respect for people and culture
    *   2. Flow
    *   3. Innovation
    *   4. Relentless improvement

**Page 11-14: Foundation: Lean-Agile Leadership**

*   **Lean Management:** A way of managing focused on making *processes* (ways of doing work) more *efficient* (achieving a goal with little waste).
    *   *Minimize waste:* Reduce costs, shorten time, prevent errors.
    *   *Process-oriented:* Focuses on *how* work is done.
    *   *Customer decides:* The customer (not just the company) helps define what is an improvement and what is waste.
*   **Lean-Agile Leadership:**
    *   Combines Lean and Agile methods.
    *   Creates a *stable foundation* and *security* for employees.
    *   Allows teams to try things, be brave, make mistakes, and learn (*sustainable team success*).
    *   Managers actively drive *changes* and *improvements*.

---

**Page 15-16: Pillar 1: Respect for People and Culture**

*   **Focus:** Creating a good work environment (*culture*).
    *   *Positive, safe, performance-oriented:* People feel good, safe, and motivated to do well.
    *   *Trust, respect, people-centered:* Treat everyone with respect.
    *   *Long-term relationships:* Build strong connections based on trust.
    *   *Who is the customer?* Anyone who uses your work (can be internal colleagues too).
    *   *Change culture:* To change the culture, you need to change the organization (how it works).

---

**Page 17-20: Pillar 2: Flow**

*   **Focus:** Making work move smoothly and continuously without delays.
*   **Harmonization:** Balancing the product needs, people's skills (*capabilities*), and customer needs (*requirements*).
*   **Optimization:** Constantly improve the process to deliver the best quality efficiently.
*   **Process to Product:** Shift focus from just the steps (*process*) to the final result (*product*).
*   **Achieving Flow:**
    *   Understand the *entire process*.
    *   *Visualize* it (e.g., using boards).
    *   Eliminate *delay* or *waste*.
    *   *Motivation* is important.
*   **SAFe Context:** *Flow* usually means *delivery flow* – the steady delivery of working software (*product increments*) to the customer. *Psychological flow* (feeling focused and productive) helps achieve this.

---

**Page 21-25: Pillar 3: Innovation**

*   **Focus:** Creating new and better ways of working and delivering value.
*   **Importance:** Helps reduce dependency on others and stay competitive.
*   **What it includes:**
    *   Not just new inventions, but *planned changes* using new ideas/techniques.
    *   Learning from others, maybe changing your *business model*.
    *   Constantly focusing on the *market* and the *customer*.
    *   Having a *vision* (where you want to go) and a *roadmap* (how to get there).
*   **How to achieve it:**
    *   Develop *innovative people*.
    *   Give *time and space* for creativity.
    *   Encourage *diversity* (different people, different ideas), *psychological safety* (feeling safe to speak up), and *freedom to think* differently.
    *   *Experiment* (try new things) and step out of your comfort zone.
    *   Have *courage* ("just do it").
*   **Levels:** Innovation can happen at different levels (strategy, behaviour, technology) and can be encouraged in different ways.

**Page 26-32: Pillar 4: Relentless Improvement**

*   **Focus:** Never stop trying to get better.
*   **Mindset:**
    *   *Constant "sense of danger":* Always be aware of potential problems or opportunities.
    *   *Solution-oriented:* Focus on finding solutions, not just problems.
    *   *Seek solutions, not problems.*
    *   *Encourage growth and learning.*
*   **Key Practices:**
    *   *Reflection:* Regularly think about events, people, and yourself to learn and improve.
    *   *Base improvements on facts* or *experience* (*empiricism* = learning from observation/experience).
*   **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act):** A useful model for continuous improvement (*Kaizen*).
    *   **Plan:** Identify a problem/opportunity and plan a change.
    *   **Do:** Implement the change (often on a small scale).
    *   **Check:** Observe the results. Did it work?
    *   **Act:** If it worked, standardize it. If not, learn and try again.
    *   Each cycle builds improvement over time.

**Page 33-36: The Goal: Value**

*   **What we want to achieve:** Deliver the *maximum customer value* in the *shortest sustainable delivery time*.
*   **How:** Using Agile methods, lean product development, and *systems thinking* (understanding how all parts connect).
*   **Result:** Provide *quality* and *added value* for society and people.
*   **Requirement:** Needs *awareness* and *openness to fundamental change*.
*   **Foundation First:** Lean-Agile leadership is the crucial starting point to achieve this goal.

---

**Page 37-42: House of Quality & Lean Mindset Recap**

*   **Customer at the Top:** All activity aims for *customer satisfaction*.
*   **Starting Point:** First, *simplify* and *standardize* processes. You can't improve if you don't know how well you meet customer needs now.
*   **Lean is a Mindset:** It's more than tools; it's a *new way of thinking*. Look at work with "fresh eyes" to remove waste and simplify.
*   **Improvement Steps (After Stabilization):** Use Lean tools like *Just-In-Time* (speed/deadlines) and *Built-In-Quality* (quality targets).
*   **Simple Lean Process:**
    1.  *Understand* customer needs & current state.
    2.  *Identify* where improvement is needed most.
    3.  *Develop* people and processes.
    4.  *Implement* changes & *measure* impact.
