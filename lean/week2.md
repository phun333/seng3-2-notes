## Slide 1: Title Slide

*   This lecture is an **Introduction to Lean** principles. It's presented by the Department of Industrial Engineering at OSTIM Technical University.

## Slide 2: What is Not Lean?

*   Lean is **NOT** just for making things (manufacturing). It can be used in many areas.
*   Lean is **NOT** just a collection of tools. It's a way of thinking.
*   Lean is **NOT** a project you do once and finish. It's ongoing.
*   Lean is **NOT** quick or easy to implement.
*   Lean is often **NOT** just decided by bosses and pushed down (top-down). It usually involves everyone (though this can be debated).

## Slide 3: What is Not Lean? (Continued)

*   Emphasizes: Lean is a bigger idea, **more than just tools**.

## Slide 4: What is Lean?

*   Lean is a **cultural change**: This means changing the basic way people in a company think and work together.
*   It focuses on **utilizing people**: Using people's skills and ideas in the best possible way.

## Slide 5: What is Lean? (Continued)

*   Lean is a **work philosophy**: A way of thinking about how to do work.
*   **Goal**: Create the **most value** (what the customer wants and is willing to pay for) for the customer.
*   **Method**: Use the **least cost** (spend the least amount of money, time, and effort).
*   **How**: By **maximizing** (using the most or best of) **resources** (things you have like people, materials, machines), time, energy, and effort needed to make a product or provide a service.

## Slide 6: What is the Concept of Lean?

*   Lean uses management practices to improve **efficiency** (doing things quickly, with less effort or waste) and **effectiveness** (doing the *right* things that achieve the goal).
*   **How**: By **eliminating waste** (getting rid of activities or things that are not needed).
*   **Core Principle**: Reduce and get rid of **non-value adding activities** (things done that the customer doesn't care about or pay for) and waste.

## Slide 7: What is the Concept of Lean? (Continued)

*   **Waste**: Anything that **doesn't add value** (doesn't make the product/service better or more useful) from the customer's point of view, or for the business itself.

## Slide 8: 8 Wastes of Lean

*   Lean identifies 8 common types of waste to eliminate:
    1.  **Inventory**: Having too much material or too many products stored.
    2.  **Non-Utilized Talent**: Not using people's skills, ideas, or knowledge.
    3.  **Overproduction**: Making too much of something, making it too soon, or making it faster than needed.
    4.  **Extra Processing**: Doing more work on a product/service than the customer needs or wants.
    5.  **Waiting**: Time spent when people or machines are idle, waiting for the next step, materials, or information.
    6.  **Resources / Transportation**: Moving materials, products, or information unnecessarily (the icon shows a truck).
    7.  **Defects**: Making mistakes or bad parts/products that need fixing or must be thrown away.
    8.  **Motion**: Unnecessary movement of people (like walking too far, bending, reaching).

## Slide 9: Why Do We Need To Learn «Lean»?

*   This section introduces *why* learning and using Lean is important for businesses.

## Slide 10: Why Learn Lean? (Continued)

*   In any business, **continuous improvement** (always trying to make things a little bit better, all the time) in:
    *   **Efficiency** (doing things faster/cheaper)
    *   **Production** (the process of making things)
    *   **Innovation** (creating new ideas, methods, or products)
*   ...leads to **profitability** (a company making more money than it spends).

## Slide 11: Why Learn Lean? (Image)

*   Visual explanation: Shows that Lean helps achieve **Profitability**. It does this by aiming to increase Sales, increase the Margin (profit per item), and decrease Costs.

## Slide 12: Why Learn Lean? (Continued)

*   Today's business world is very **competitive** (many companies are trying to succeed against each other).
*   Companies need an **edge** (an advantage over others).
*   Lean helps provide this edge through:
    *   Higher quality products/services.
    *   Lower costs.
    *   Shorter **supply chain lead times** (the total time it takes from the start of a process, like ordering materials, to the end, like delivering to the customer).

## Slide 13: Why Learn Lean? (Slogan)

*   "Time is Money, Money is Time."
*   Simple idea: Wasting time costs money. Saving time (being faster and more efficient) helps save or make money. Lean focuses strongly on reducing wasted time.

## Slide 14: Why Learn Lean? (Continued)

*   Lean management can be used as a **business model** (a company's basic plan for how it will make money) to help companies achieve goals like better quality, lower cost, and faster delivery.

## Slide 15: Why Learn Lean? (Continued)

*   Lean's main purpose: To **transform** (change completely) a company's **culture** (the shared way people think and act) into one that values **continuous improvement** over the **long term** (not just for a short project, but always).

## Slide 16: The Benefits of Lean Manufacturing

*   Using Lean ideas in manufacturing (making things) brings key benefits:
    *   Improves **efficiency** (less effort/cost for the same output).
    *   Reduces **waste** (less unnecessary activity, material, time).
    *   Increases **productivity** (getting more useful output from the resources used).

## Slide 17: The Benefits of Lean Manufacturing (Detailed)

*   **Increased product quality**: When processes are more efficient, people have more time/resources to focus on making things better.
*   **Improved lead times**: When processes are **streamlined** (made simpler, smoother, and faster), companies can react better to customer **fluctuations** (ups and downs) in demand. This means fewer delays and faster delivery.
*   **Sustainability**: By reducing variations and waste, the business becomes stronger and better able to succeed long into the future (**sustainability**) and change when needed (**adaptability**).
*   **Employee satisfaction**: Removing frustrating, unnecessary work makes jobs better. This improves employee **morale** (how happy and motivated employees feel). Lean improves both productivity AND employee happiness.
*   **Increased profits**: Doing more with less (more productivity, less waste) and making better products (better quality) naturally leads to more profit.

## Slide 18: The Benefits of Lean Manufacturing (Visual Summary)

*   A diagram summarizing what Lean helps to reduce and improve:
*   **Reductions** in: Defects, Lead time, Cost, Inventory, Space needed, Waste.
*   **Improvements** in: Productivity, Customer Satisfaction, **Capacity** (how much the company can produce), **Responsiveness** (how quickly the company can react to changes or customer needs), Quality, Profit.

## Slide 19: Financial Benefits

*   If Lean principles are used correctly, the **financial benefits** (advantages related to money) for the company are usually very large (**highly significant**).

## Slide 20: Financial Benefits (Continued)

*   Reducing waste and defects directly saves money.
*   Making better quality products often leads to higher profits (e.g., more sales, better prices).

## Slide 21: Financial Benefits (Continued)

*   Saving money on **product storage** (keeping finished goods) and **inventory management** (controlling materials and parts) adds extra **cash flow** (money available for the company to use).

## Slide 22: Customer-oriented Benefits (Worker Focus)

*   Having **satisfied workers** (happy, motivated employees) makes the business run better and helps it succeed in the long run. (Happy workers often provide better service to customers).

## Slide 23: Customer-oriented Benefits (Customer Focus)

*   **Satisfied customers** (happy customers) are more likely to stay with the company (**customer retention**) and choose the company again and again (**customer loyalty**). Happy customers might also tell others.

## Slide 24: Top 10 Benefits of Lean (Survey Results)

*   Based on a survey of companies using Lean, here are the top 10 reported benefits:
    1.  Better management of complex teams or processes.
    2.  More efficient business processes overall.
    3.  Better ability to handle changing priorities.
    4.  Better project visibility (easier for the team to see progress).
    5.  Increased team productivity.
    6.  Reduced lead time (faster delivery).
    7.  Increased team morale (happier teams).
    8.  Improved visibility for **stakeholders** (people interested in the company, like owners, managers, investors).
    9.  Reduced costs.
    10. More **predictable** (reliable, consistent) delivery of value to customers.

## Slide 25: The 5 Basic Lean Principles

*   **Lean thinking**: A way of thinking that focuses all company actions on creating **value** for the customer through **continuous improvement**.
*   The 5 core principles are shown in a cycle: Specify Value, Identify Value Stream, Create Flow, Establish Pull, Seek Perfection.

## Slide 26: 5 Basic Lean Principles (Diagram)

*   Another diagram showing the 5 principles, emphasizing the focus on the customer throughout the cycle.

## Slide 27: The 5 Basic Lean Principles (Detailed)

1.  **Specify Value**: Clearly define what value means from the **customer's perspective** for a specific product or service.
2.  **Identify and Create Value Streams**: Map out all the steps (actions) needed to bring a product/service from start to finish (**value stream**). Identify and remove steps that don't add value (waste).
3.  **Create Flow**: Make the value-adding steps happen smoothly, one after the other, without interruptions, waiting, or delays.
4.  **Establish Pull**: Work should only be done when the next step (internal customer) or the final customer signals a need. Don't make things before they are needed (**Pull Production**). This is the opposite of **Push Production** (making things based on forecasts and storing them).
5.  **Seek Perfection**: Continuously strive (try hard) to improve every part of the process, aiming for a situation where value is created with zero waste (**Perfection**).

## Slide 28: Lean Principles (Foundation)

*   Lean thinking requires understanding that activities fall into three types:
    *   **Value (Green)**: Activities that directly create value the customer wants. Keep these.
    *   **Non-Value But Needed (Yellow)**: Activities that don't add value for the customer but seem necessary now (e.g., inspections, regulations). Try to reduce or eliminate these. (Sometimes called Type 2 Waste).
    *   **7+1 Waste (Red)**: Activities that add no value and are not necessary. Eliminate these completely. (Sometimes called Type 1 Waste).

## Slide 29: Lean Principles: Value

*   **Identifying Value**:
    *   The main focus should always be on creating **customer value**.
    *   Always look at processes and activities from the **customer's viewpoint**.
*   Types of Tasks/Activities:
    *   **Value-adding (VA)**: Directly transforms the product/service in a way the customer values.
    *   **Non-value adding, but necessary (NNVA)**: Required for business (e.g., legal reporting) but adds no direct customer value. (Type 2 Waste).
    *   **Non-value adding (NVA)**: Pure waste; consumes resources but adds no value. (Type 1 Waste).
*   In Lean, all NVA tasks (and ideally NNVA tasks too) are considered **Waste** to be reduced or eliminated.

## Slide 30: Lean Principles: Value (Diagram)

*   This diagram shows that the total time for a process (**lead time**) is mostly made up of **Waste** time, with only a small part being actual **Value**-adding time.
*   Traditional improvement efforts might slightly reduce waste.
*   The **Lean approach** focuses intensely on cutting out the Waste time, making the overall process much faster and more efficient.

## Slide 31: Lean Principles: Flow

*   **Flow**: Aim to have the value-adding activities happen smoothly one after another, adding maximum value at each step without delays.
*   **Eliminate**: Inventories between steps, waiting time, **rework** (fixing mistakes), and **stoppages** (work halting).
*   Example: Think about a hospital visit. Most time is often spent waiting (waste), not receiving actual treatment (value-adding time or **Process time**).
*   **Lead Time**: Total time from start to finish.
*   **Process Time**: Time actually spent working on the item ('touch time').
*   **Cycle Time**: Time it takes to complete one unit of work.

## Slide 32: Lean Principles: Pull

*   **Pull**: Only produce or do work when there is an **expressed need** (a clear signal or request) from the next step or the final customer (**internal or external customer**).
*   Benefit: Reduces waste by avoiding making, managing, or storing things that aren't needed yet (avoids overproduction and excess inventory).
*   How it works: Customer demand (or the need of the next process step) **pulls** the work through the system. This is different from **Push**, where items are made based on a plan or forecast and then pushed forward, regardless of immediate need.

## Slide 33: Lean Principles: Perfection

*   **Perfection**: This is the goal of always trying to get better. It's about continuous improvement.
*   How: Lean teams constantly **analyze** (examine closely) each process to find ways to increase value (e.g., make it better, faster, cheaper) and eliminate waste.
*   Focus: Keep the value-adding steps, remove the non-value adding steps. Make the flow smoother (**tighten the flow**). Deliver exactly the value the customer needs, when they need it.
*   Uses **Continuous Improvement**:
    *   **Kaizen**: Making small, ongoing improvements regularly.
    *   **Kaikaku**: Making big, significant changes or improvements (like redesigning a process).

## Slide 34: Lean Software Development: 5+ Practices Worth Following

*   This shows how Lean ideas can be used in **software development** (which relates to Computer Networks when considering network services or software). Key practices include (diagram shows 7):
    *   **Optimize the Whole**: Look at the entire system or value stream, not just optimizing small parts in isolation.
    *   **Create Knowledge**: Emphasize learning, documenting, and sharing knowledge within the team.
    *   **Eliminate Waste**: Identify and remove waste in the software process (e.g., unnecessary features, delays, task switching, defects).
    *   **Build Quality In** (shown as "Best Quality In"): Ensure quality at every step, don't just test at the end (e.g., automated testing, code reviews).
    *   **Fast Delivery**: Deliver working software to the customer quickly and frequently in small batches.
    *   **Empower Your Team**: Trust the development team and give them the authority to make decisions about their work.
    *   **Defer Commitment** (shown as "Delay in Making Decisions"): Avoid making irreversible decisions too early. Keep options open as long as possible.

## Slide 35: Lean and Agile Landscape

*   This Venn diagram compares **Lean** and **Agile** (another popular approach for software development). They have different origins but share many ideas and work well together.
*   **Lean Focus (in software)**:
    *   Increase customer value by eliminating waste.
    *   Carefully consider decisions to avoid making them **prematurely** (too early).
    *   Act decisively and quickly once a decision is made.
*   **Agile Focus** (based on Agile Manifesto):
    *   Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
    *   Value working software over comprehensive documentation.
    *   Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
    *   Value responding to change over following a plan.
*   **Overlap / Shared Ideas**: Using lightweight **artifacts** (simple documentation/tools), focusing on preventing errors (fail-proofing), and being flexible and adaptive.
