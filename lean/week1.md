## Slide 3: Lean Manufacturing Definition 1

*   **Key Point:** Lean manufacturing is a **production method**.
*   **Simple Definition:** `Production method`: A way or system used to make products.

---

## Slide 4: Lean Manufacturing Primary Goal

*   **Key Concept:** The main goal (**primary goal**) is **reducing times**.
*   **Details:** This includes time inside the factory (**production system**) and time dealing with others (**response times** from suppliers and to customers).
*   **Simple Definitions:**
    *   `Reducing times`: Making the time needed shorter.
    *   `Production system`: All the steps, people, and tools used to make something.
    *   `Response times`: How fast someone answers or acts (like a supplier sending parts).
    *   `Primary goal`: The most important aim.

---

## Slide 5: Transition

*   Indicates that the previous definition (Slide 3 & 4) is not the whole story.

---

## Slide 6: Lean Manufacturing Definition 2

*   **Key Concept:** Lean Manufacturing is a **management philosophy**.
*   **Goal:** Create the **maximum amount of value** for the customer with the **least amount of waste**.
*   **Simple Definitions:**
    *   `Management philosophy`: A main idea or belief about how to manage work.
    *   `Value`: What the customer finds useful and is willing to pay for.
    *   `Waste`: Anything using time, money, or effort that *doesn't* add value for the customer.

---

## Slide 7: Lean and JIT

*   **Key Concept:** Lean manufacturing is related to **just-in-time manufacturing (JIT)**.
*   **JIT Aim:** Match production to **demand** (make only what's ordered).
*   **JIT Focus:** **Efficiency**, **productivity**, **continuous improvement**, and **reduction of wastes**.
*   **Simple Definitions:**
    *   `Just-in-time (JIT)`: Making or receiving parts/products exactly when needed.
    *   `Demand`: What customers want or order.
    *   `Efficiency`: Doing things well without wasting time or energy.
    *   `Productivity`: Making more things or doing more work in the same amount of time.
    *   `Continuous improvement`: Always trying to make things a little better.
    *   `Reduction of wastes`: Making less waste.

---

## Slide 8: Lean vs. JIT

*   **Key Concept:** Lean uses the JIT idea but *also* focuses on reducing **cycle**, **flow**, and **throughput times**.
*   **How:** By removing (**eliminating**) activities that **do not add any value** for the customer.
*   **Simple Definitions:**
    *   `Cycle time`: Time to finish one piece of work or one product.
    *   `Flow time` / `Throughput time`: Total time something takes to go through the whole process from start to finish.
    *   `Eliminating activities`: Getting rid of steps.
    *   `Do not add any value`: Steps that the customer doesn't care about or pay for.

    1.  **Define the value** (from the customer's view).
    2.  **Identify the value flow** (map the steps, find waste).
    3.  **Create the flow** (make value-steps happen smoothly).
    4.  **Pull the flows** (make only when requested - JIT).
    5.  **Seeking perfection** (always try to improve).

---
