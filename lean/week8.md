*   This slide visually shows the six areas from Slide 8 connected to a central handshake icon representing Respect for People.

**Slide 10: Respect for People: Respect (Focus on Skills)**
*   **Lean Waste - "Skills":** Not using a person's full abilities (*potential*), knowledge (*expertise*), or past learning (*experience*) is considered a waste in Lean.
*   **Why it's waste:** You lose chances to solve problems and improve processes.
*   **Term:** *Waste (in Lean)*: Anything that doesn't add value to the customer or process.
*   **Term:** *Potential*: What someone is capable of doing.
*   **Term:** *Expertise*: Special skill or knowledge.
*   **Term:** *Experience*: Knowledge gained from doing things.

**Slide 11: Realizing Full Capability**
*   **Goal:** Respect-for-people helps ensure a person uses their *full capability*.

*   **Respectful Action:** Providing *standard processes* is a way to respect employees.
*   **How:** Work *with* employees to *define* (figure out) and *implement* (put in place) the best way to do the job.
*   **Support:** Standard processes are helped by:
    *   *Workplace organisation* (like 6S).
    *   *Visual workplace* (making it easy to see what to do).
*   **Goal:** Make it easy to see what needs doing and then do it.
*   **Term:** *Implement*: To start using a plan or system.
*   **Term:** *Visual workplace*: Using signs, labels, colors, etc., to make work clearer.

*   **Goal:** Enable people to find (*identify*) and fix (*solve*) daily problems.

**Slide 23: Employee Perspective**
*   **Benefits for Employees:** When management invests in people, employees should feel:
    *   Increased *job security* (less likely to lose their job).
    *   Improved *morale* (feeling happier and more positive about work).
*   **Term:** *Perspective*: A point of view.
*   **Term:** *Morale*: The confidence, enthusiasm, and discipline of a person or group.

**Slide 24: Respect for People: Problem Solving**
*   **Question 1:** What do you do when there's a problem? (Assuming you already have the best way/layout).
*   **Question 2:** How do you:

*   **Management Limitation:** Managers might not know all the details of the work to fix problems alone.
*   **Employee Hesitation:** Employees might not be ready to question their own work or how to fix issues by themselves.
*   **Outcome:** Employees need to be *challenged* (encouraged and supported) to solve problems.

**Slide 27: Mutual Respect in Problem Solving**
*   **Requirement:** *Mutual respect* (Slide 13) is needed for success.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Employees are *challenged* to gather facts about what's really happening.
    2.  Management provides help (*coaching*) to find the *root cause*.
    3.  *Together*, they review options, agree on a solution, decide how to measure success, and choose the best action.
*   **Term:** *Coaching*: Guiding and helping someone learn or improve.

**Slide 28: Respect for People: Teamwork**
*   **Employee Role:** Employees are also *stakeholders* (people with an interest) in the company's success, not just managers.

*   **Positive Leadership:** Taking a helpful (*constructive*) approach and being responsible (*taking personal responsibility*) for your attitude and actions.

**Slide 30: Summary - Connecting the Dots**
*   **Connection:** A *safe working environment*, *standardized processes*, and *structured problem solving* might seem separate from respect, but they are essential for a successful Lean organization.
*   **Why they are respect:** They show the organization values its people enough to provide these things.

**Slide 31: Summary - Lack of Respect**
*   **Negative Example:** Making people work in a bad environment with unclear expectations shows a *lack of respect*.
*   **"Heroes":** This creates "heroes" – people who have to work extremely hard just to get the job done, which isn't efficient or sustainable.

**Slide 32: Summary - Origin Principle**
*   **Core Principle:** Lean principles are based on *respect* (originally called *respect-for-humanity*).

**Slide 33: Summary - Harnessing Value**
*   **Benefit:** Great value comes from using the *skills*, *knowledge*, and *experience* of the people actually doing the work.
*   **Valuable Ideas:** These people have good ideas for improving their work and the whole operation.

**Slide 34: Summary - Inclusiveness and Improvement**
*   **Action:** Respect-for-people creates a feeling of being included (*sense of inclusiveness*).
*   **How:**
    *   Involving people in daily problem solving.

**Slide 36: Practical Ways Title**
*   **New Section:** 7 Practical Ways to Respect People.

**Slide 37: How to Respect?**
*   **Question:** How exactly do you show respect?
*   **Point:** It seems simple, but it's not always easy.

**Slide 38: Practical Way 1: Look at People**
*   **Don't Do:** Checking phone/email while someone is talking to you is NOT respectful.
*   **Do:** Look the person *in the eyes* during conversations.
*   **Action:** Close laptops, put away phones if needed.

**Slide 39: Practical Way 2: Listen. Really Listen.**
*   **Action:** While making eye contact, truly *listen*.
*   **Show You're Listening:** Sometimes, you need to say something back (*say a few things back*) that shows you understood (has *substance*).
*   **Term:** *Substance*: Real meaning or importance.

**Slide 40: Practical Way 3: Don't always agree.**
*   **Myth:** Being respectful doesn't mean you must always agree. Disagreement is okay.
*   **Example:** A boss saying if everyone agrees, most are unneeded – different ideas are valuable.
*   **Key Idea:** Healthy disagreement can be respectful and useful.

**Slide 41: Practical Way 4: Don't disagree just to disagree.**
*   **Don't Do:** Don't always try to find something to disagree with just to feel important (*justify your existence*).
*   **Do:** If you agree and have nothing to add, just say so positively (e.g., "Sounds great... Let me know if I can help.").

**Slide 42: Practical Way 5: Engage the Gemba.**
*   **Term:** *Genchi Genbutsu*: A Lean term meaning "go and see" – go to the place where work is actually done to see for yourself.
*   **Benefit:** Going to the *gemba* (the workplace) lets you truly *engage* (get involved) in the situation.
*   **Action:** You might even help solve the problem directly (*get your hands dirty*).
*   **Term:** *Gemba*: The actual place where work happens (e.g., factory floor, office desk).

**Slide 43: Practical Way 6: Increase the tension.**
*   **Toyota Contradiction:** Toyota often creates positive pressure (*incredible tension*) in the organization.
*   **How:**
    *   Setting very hard (*incredibly difficult*) goals.
    *   Reminding people (*preaching*) that the company needs everyone's effort to succeed (*stay in business*).
*   **Idea:** A fair amount of tension or challenge can be a *good thing* if balanced.

**Slide 44: Practical Way 7: See the forest.**
*   **Leader's Role:** As a leader, keep the big picture (*keep your eyes down field* / *don't lose sight of the forest for the trees*) in mind.
*   **Reason:** Sometimes doing the right thing for the long term might involve difficult conversations (which *may not be fun*), but are necessary.
*   **Analogy:** *Forest for the trees*: Don't get so focused on small details (trees) that you miss the overall situation (forest).

**Slide 45: Thank You**
*   End of presentation.
